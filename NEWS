Here I add changes which may be important for you. See ChangeLog for more
details and the manual pages (docs/*.html) for a more complete description
of added options.

0.0.10
- there is now alias support. Give the location of the alias file (usually /etc/aliases) with eg.
alias_file = "/etc/aliases"
- delivery to pipes is now possible, but only if it appears in an alias file. Example:
pipe: |/usr/bin/command
will expand the address pipe to "|/usr/bin/command" which invokes '/usr/bin/command'
as the user and group masqmail is running as.
- entries starting with '\' in alias files will not be exanded further

- changed permissions for queue runs again: got to be root, mail or in group trusted.

- some configuration parameters can be read from files, these are
allowed_mail_locals, not_allowed_mail_locals, allowed_rcpt_domains, not_allowed_rcpt_domains,
map_return_path_addresses, map_h_from_addresses, map_h_reply_to_addresses
any entry in these list beginning with a '/' are regarded as
filenames, the content of these will be put at that location. Entries
in these files are separated by new lines.  Example:
in the route file you have:
map_h_from_addresses = "/etc/masqmail/hfrom.map"
and hfrom.map contains:

john: John Smith <jsmith@mail.academic.edu>
cmiller: "Charlie Miller" <cmiller@foo.com>

UPDATE (Jan 2000): The new home location of MasqMail is
http://www.innominate.org/~oku/masqmail/, the new email adress of the
author is Oliver Kurth <kurth@innominate.de>.

0.0.9
- see ChangeLog.

NOTE: The home location of MasqMail at
http://merlin.uni-sw.gwdg.de/~okurth/masqmail/ is uncertain from the
beginning of Nov. 1999! See http://www.freshmeat.net for new
announcements. I leave the university and begin a new job on Nov. 1st 1999
in Berlin :-).

0.0.8:
- there is now a FAQ page. See docs/faq.html.
- added allowed_rcpt_domains option for routes.
- added allowed_mail_locals and not_allowed_mail_locals options for routes.
- mailq now gives information about the time mails spent in the queue,
the message size and the received host.

0.0.7:
-bug fix release: for statements in two	adjacent lines, the second was not recognized.

0.0.6:
- bug fix release: some MUAs (cucipop) saw the locally delivered mails
concatenated. (cucipop is not a MUA  but a pop server, but it has to read the
mails).

0.0.5:
- fixed a bug that caused the headers to be lost under some circumstances.
- added expand_h_sender_domain option for routes.
- rewrote the libresolv part in configure. Should work better now.

  These will be created if not already existent.

  for MasqMail.

0.0.3:
- MasqMail can now deliver mails that are received at online
  time immediately to the internet. See the options detect_online,
  mserver_iface and online_file.
- You can define a route configuration for the local net. See option
  local_net_route.

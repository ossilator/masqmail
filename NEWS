Here I add changes which may be important for you. See ChangeLog for more
details and the manual pages for a more complete description
of added options.

0.1.15

- this is a security fix release. When an alias expansion expands to a pipe,
  only the effective uid was changed to mail, but not the real uid. This way,
  a command could gain root privileges. This is no longer possible, masqmail
  drops prvileges completely before executing the pipe command.

0.1.9

- you can use pipes in routes to implement gateways to uucp, fax, sms etc.
The setup is similar to mda transport. See man pages.

- for each connection (connect_routes), you can now give a list of
route files, which will be used in the order given. You can use the
filter rules (allowed_* and not_allowed_* rules) within each route.

0.1.8

- for pop retrieval and smtp sending you can use a wrapper for eg. ssl
tunneling. See man pages.

- a user can delete his mail from the spool with -Mrm if received
locally, and if you configure with --enable-ident and set
ident_trusted_nets also if received via smtp.

- a backslash now works to escape characters in the configuration, so
you can now use quotes inside quotes. All other characters with a
leading backslash will be converted to itself (\a becomes a, \\
becomes \).

- you can now use an mda for local mails. The mda will be called
*after* alias expansion. See documentation for more.

0.1.0
- masqmail can now retrieve mail with pop3. See the manual on how to do that.
- supports now ESMTP AUTH as a client.
- when called with -qo (without a connection name), the online status
will be checked with the configured method.

0.0.10
- there is now alias support. Give the location of the alias file (usually /etc/aliases) with eg.
alias_file = "/etc/aliases"
- delivery to pipes is now possible, but only if it appears in an alias file. Example:
pipe: |/usr/bin/command
will expand the address pipe to "|/usr/bin/command" which invokes '/usr/bin/command'
as the user and group masqmail is running as.
- entries starting with '\' in alias files will not be exanded further

- changed permissions for queue runs again: got to be root, mail or in group trusted.

- some configuration parameters can be read from files, these are
allowed_mail_locals, not_allowed_mail_locals, allowed_rcpt_domains, not_allowed_rcpt_domains,
map_return_path_addresses, map_h_from_addresses, map_h_reply_to_addresses
any entry in these list beginning with a '/' are regarded as
filenames, the content of these will be put at that location. Entries
in these files are separated by new lines.  Example:
in the route file you have:
map_h_from_addresses = "/etc/masqmail/hfrom.map"
and hfrom.map contains:

john: John Smith <jsmith@mail.academic.edu>
cmiller: "Charlie Miller" <cmiller@foo.com>

UPDATE (Jan 2000): The new home location of MasqMail is
http://www.innominate.org/~oku/masqmail/, the new email adress of the
author is Oliver Kurth <kurth@innominate.de>.

0.0.9
- see ChangeLog.

NOTE: The home location of MasqMail at
http://merlin.uni-sw.gwdg.de/~okurth/masqmail/ is uncertain from the
beginning of Nov. 1999! See http://www.freshmeat.net for new
announcements. I leave the university and begin a new job on Nov. 1st 1999
in Berlin :-).

0.0.8:
- there is now a FAQ page. See docs/faq.html.
- added allowed_rcpt_domains option for routes.
- added allowed_mail_locals and not_allowed_mail_locals options for routes.
- mailq now gives information about the time mails spent in the queue,
the message size and the received host.

0.0.7:
-bug fix release: for statements in two	adjacent lines, the second was not recognized.

0.0.6:
- bug fix release: some MUAs (cucipop) saw the locally delivered mails
concatenated. (cucipop is not a MUA  but a pop server, but it has to read the
mails).

0.0.5:
- fixed a bug that caused the headers to be lost under some circumstances.
- added expand_h_sender_domain option for routes.
- rewrote the libresolv part in configure. Should work better now.

0.0.4:
- MM should now recognize whether libresolv should be linked.
- added --with-logdir=LOGDIR and --with-spooldir=SPOOLDIR to set directories.
  These will be created if not already existent.
- added --with-user=USER, --with-group=GROUP options to set user and group id
  for MasqMail.

0.0.3:
- MasqMail can now deliver mails that are received at online
  time immediately to the internet. See the options detect_online,
  mserver_iface and online_file.
- You can define a route configuration for the local net. See option
  local_net_route.

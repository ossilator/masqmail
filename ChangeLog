	* unprivileged user can delete his own mail from queue if received locally
	* replaced popen() in local.c with peopen() from snippet from sourceforge. Fixed a bug there.
0.1.7:
	* debug option can be changed for privileged users only

	* included pop3 client support, with UIDL and APOP, single drop only
	* rearranged routing code:
	  - messages will be deleted from spool earlier, as soon as they are delivered
	  - unified online/offline delivery, making it more simple
	
0.0.13:
        * ignore set_h_{from,reply_to}_domain if map_h_{from,reply_to}_addresses
        is set and warn in logs about misconfiguration.
        * fail if there are no recipients
        * fixed bug: if called with -t, qualify recipient address with host_name
        * fixed bug: if called with -bi, no longer wait for message on stdin

        (noted by Frank Schnekenbuehl)
        * say 'mail queue is empty' if mail queue is empty (Thanks to
        Frank Schnekenbuehl)
        * fixed bug: setegid in local.c (was noted by both Michael Piefel and
        Alberto González Palomo)
0.0.11:
        * if Bcc: headers have been removed (-t option), and there is no To:
        or Cc: header,an empty Bcc: header will be created (RFC 822
        compliance!)
        * fixed bug: if rcpts are given on command line To: headers were
        created, even if they already existed. This caused Bcc: recipient
        addresses to be revealed if they were given on the cmd line.
        Now a To: header is only created if there is no To:, Cc: or Bcc:
        header. Thanks to Richard Clamp for pointing this out.
        * fixed bug: segfault when -d option was given without arguments
        * fixed bug: segfault when configuration file not found
0.0.10:

	* pipe transport implemented
	* alias support implemented.
	* changed permissions for queue runs again: got to be root,
	mail or in group trusted.
	* some configuration parameters can be read from files
	* internal changes in routing logics/deliver code, preparing for
	aliases support.
	* Gregor Hoffleit sent another patch: use liblockfile if available
	(Debian!) and DESTDIR will be used. Also updated the NEWS file. Thanks
	again!
	* define fdatasync to fsync if not available.
	* lookup.c includes sys/types.h, some environments need this
	* fixed bug in RFC 822 parsing: name in brackets after address
	caused problems. Thanks to David Maslen.
	* values in tables without leading spaces
0.0.9:
	* anyone in group 'trusted' is now allowed to do queue runs. Thanks to
	Alberto Gonzalez Palomo for the suggestion.
	* changed umask for spool writing to 026.
	* removed silly 'no rcpt domain for this route' message
	* there is now a mailing list
	(see http://www.innominate.org/mailman/listinfo/masqmail)
	* Gregor Hoffleit sent a patch to make masqmail work with mutt (and
	balsa and any other MUA that uses the mutt libs): it now supports
	'--' in options. Thanks!
	* accept_message() supports flag ACC_NO_RECVD_HDR (but this is not
	used in masqmail).
	* accept_message() is no longer responsible for queuing, makes it
	easier to recycle the code for other projects (eg. jpilot-Mail)
0.0.8:
	* added a FAQ page.
	* removed all warnings, at least for egcs. Output of make looks
	pretty now ;-)
	* added allowed_mail_locals and not_allowed_mail_locals options for
	routes.
	* implemented folding und unfolding of headers (but currently used
	for the Received: header only).
	* corrected docs: should be 'online_detect', NOT 'detect_online'.
	* mailq now gives information about the time mails spent in the queue,
	the message size and the received host.
	* added allowed_rcpt_domains option for routes.
	* increased buffer size to 1024 for SMTP responses when delivering.
	* fixed minor bug: slash in unquoted strings in conf parsing was not
	allowed.
0.0.7:
	* fixed a bug in smtp_out.c: sock was tested before it was initialized.
	* fixed a bug in the configuration code: for statements in two
	adjacent lines, the second was not recognized.
0.0.6:
	* rewrote part of the configuration parsing code because it caused
	problems with reading config statements on multiple lines.
	* added a LF after each mail local mail spool file, as this
	seems to be required for some MUAs and especially cucipop when
	it reads mails. Otherwise mails seem to be concatenated. Thanks
	to Dale Perkel for pointing this out.
0.0.5:
	* added  expand_h_sender_domain option (boolean, default: true)
	because some clients use the Sender: address as the sender address
	(though it should be the From: address).
	* changed configure script to better recognize whether libresolv
	should be linked or not.
	* fixed a nasty bug: if masqmail -q was called (or qo <name>
 	and a mail was not delivered), the headers were lost! Problem was an
 	additional LF after received_host in the spool file.
0.0.4:
	* 'From' hack is now a 'From ' hack.
	* configure now accepts options --with-logdir=LOGDIR and
	--with-spooldir=SPOOLDIR.
	* the directories /var/masqmail and /var/spool/masqmail will now be
	created with make install; user and group will be set appropriately
	* configure now accepts options --with-user=USER and --with-group=GROUP
	* dove into autoconf: configure now recognizes libc5 and links with
	libresolv only for libc6 and defines getline for libc5
	* fixed timeout code when sending. This was broken in some earlier
	version.
0.0.3:
	* fixed bug in spool write code: rcpt address was written incorrectly
	to spool file under some circumstances (with a LF).
	* added methods for online detection (file and mserver) and added code
	to deliver immediately when mail is received at online time.
	* too many changes to list: rearranged routing code, unified smtp
	deliveries to the local net with online deliveries, so now route
	configurations can be used for the local net. Also multiple messages
	per connection for the local net possible. And reduced code size.
	* fixed bug: if server does not use neither the esmtp size extension
	nor pipelining, output after MAIL FROM was not flushed. So MM waited
	forever for a response...
0.0.2:
	* fixed bug: euid was not set properly for local delivery
	* when debugging, it does not write the whole message to the log
	any more.
	* added 'From' hack
	* qualified address for return path and recipients is now required
	if not accepted locally, if locally accepted the addresses will be
	qualified with host_name. (Thereby fixed a seg fault bug)
	* added -i option (same as -oi)
	* added more header rewriting (set_ and map_ options)
	* fixed bug: potential seg fault when writing spool files because it
	was not read properly
	* multiple messages per connection now also if mail is sent directly
	(same for local_nets is still missing, but I will use routes for these
	anyway in the future)
	* the queue will now be read in random order
	* implemented multiple messages per connection (but only online
	and if mail_host is defined)
	* implemented rewriting of local parts in return path for online
	delivery
	* domain matching is no longer case sensitive (had to define
	_GNU_SOURCE so that I could use FNM_CASEFOLD for fnmatch)
	* added do_correct_helo option for routes
	* fixed bug: corrected retrying hosts if one failed (connect.c).
0.0.1:
	* fixed bug: seg fault when delivering online directly and there was
	more than one rcpt to a single host.
	* fixed bug: if mail was succesfully delivered in online mode to all
	rcpts, and if there were additional (local) rcpts for which the mail
	was not	yet delivered, the mail was deleted from spool.
	* rearranged smtp_out.c to prepare for multiple messages per connection
	* log now shows the real host a message is sent to by SMTP (previously
	it was the one looked for, now it is the one that was found by DNS)
	* added NOOP, HELP and not recognized replies in smtp_in
	* fixed bug: forgot to close dup_sock in accept_connect (listen.c)
	* can now list the queue with the -bp option or when called as mailq
	* debug_level is now configurable and -d option added
	* corrected rfc821 address parsing and rearranged code
0.0.0:
	* initial release

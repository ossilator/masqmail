simple installation instructions, see docs/install.html for more.

To compile MasqMail you need glib 1.2 (http://www.gtk.org).

You need a user and a group for masqmail to run, I suggest user
'mail' and group 'trusted'. Say:

groupadd -g 42 trusted
useradd -u 42 -g 42 -d / -s /bin/sh -c "Mail Transfer Agent" mail

If you use other names than 'mail' and 'trusted' use the options
described below for configure. The 42 is just a suggestion, you can
use any number you like, but preferably one < 100. It does not have
to be the same for the user 'mail' and the group 'trusted'.

Then do:

./configure
make
make install

Sorry, but after that you are not yet finished. For instruction on how
to deliver mail using a connection to your ISP see
docs/install.html. It is probably a good idea to copy the files
docs/*.html to a directory where you can access them with a browser.

additional options for configure:
---------------------------------

--with-user=USER sets the user as which MasqMail will run. Default is
'mail'. USER has to exist before you 'make install'.

--with-group=GROUP sets the group as which MasqMail will run. Default
is 'trusted'. GROUP has to exist before you 'make install'.

--with-logdir=LOGDIR sets the directory where MasqMail stores its log
files. It will be created if it does not exist. Default is /var/masqmail/.

--with-spooldir=SPOOLDIR sets the directory where MasqMail stores its
spool files. It will be created if it does not exist. Default is
/var/spool/masqmail/.

after make install:
-------------------

You can also use these instructions to omit 'make install' if you do
not want to use it.

Check that 'make install' worked correctly. The following command:

ls -ld /usr/sbin/masqmail /var/masqmail/ /var/spool/masqmail /var/spool/masqmail/input

should give output similar to

-rwsr-xr-x   1 root     root        86955 Oct 14 14:27 /usr/sbin/masqmail
drwxr-xr-x   2 mail     trusted      1024 Oct 14 14:29 /var/masqmail/
drwxr-xr-x   3 mail     trusted      1024 Oct 14 14:27 /var/spool/masqmail
drwxr-xr-x   2 mail     trusted      1024 Oct 14 18:32 /var/spool/masqmail/input

(important is the set-user-id bit for /usr/sbin/masqmail and the
ownership of all items).

Use the example configuration files in examples/ to edit your own. The
main configuration should go to /etc/masqmail.conf. I recommend to
make a directory /etc/masqmail for the *.route files.

The default destination for the executable 'masqmail' is
/usr/sbin. Check that it has the set user id bit set. (chmod u+s
/usr/sbin/masqmail does no harm in any case).

If you want to replace sendmail, move your old sendmail binary to
another name and make a symbolic link /usr/sbin/sendmail ->
/usr/sbin/masqmail.

.SH NAME
masqmail.aliases \- masqmail alias file format


.SH DESCRIPTION

This man page describes the format of the masqmail alias files.

Two types of aliases are supported: \(lqnormal\(rq and
\(lqglob pattern\(rq.
The difference between the two types is on the left-hand side:
A normal alias file uses fixed strings that are compared with the
addresses' local part,
whereas a glob alias file uses glob patterns that are matched against
the whole addresses.
The right-hand side of the two types is identical.

The normal alias file's location is configured via the
.B alias_file
option, which is traditionally set to
.IR /etc/aliases .
The glob alias file is configured via the
.B globalias_file
option.


.SH FILE FORMAT

Normal alias files consist of lines of the form:

.RS
local_part: item1, item2, ...
.RE

Glob-pattern alias files consist of lines of the form:

.RS
glob_pattern: item1, item2, ...
.RE

Individual items can be surrounded by double quotes.
If within the quotes other quotes are needed for an address,
they can be escaped using backslashes, which can be escaped in turn.

An item with a leading backslash indicates that this address shall not
be further expanded.
If quotes are needed, the backslash must appear within the quotes,
and be escaped.

A leading pipe symbol
.RB ( | )
indicates that the item shall be treated as a pipe command.
The content of the message will then be sent to the standard input of the
command.
The command will run under the user id and group id masqmail is running as.
If quotes are needed, the pipe symbol must appear within the quotes.

Loops will be detected, the offending address will be ignored.

Aliases are read at delivery time.
This means that if there is a message still in the queue and you change
any alias which matches one of the recipient addresses,
the change will take effect next time a delivery is attempted.

There is no need to restart masqmail or run any command when the alias
file has been changed. (\(lqmasqmail\ \-bi\(rq is a no-op.)


.SH EXAMPLE

A normal alias file:

.RS
.nf
# postmaster is required by RFC 2821
postmaster: root

# forward abuse mail to another address
abuse: abuse@example.org

# copy root's mail also to meillo
root: \eroot, meillo

# pass mail to a script
foo: |/usr/bin/foo
.fi
.RE


A glob-pattern alias file:

.RS
.nf
# the postmaster for any domain on this host
postmaster@*: ken

# split virtual domains
info@foo.example.org: doug
info@bar.example.org: rob

# the order of the entries is important;
# this must come before the catch-all line
list\-*@example.org: |/path/to/some/script

# catch-all address forwarded to extern
*@example.org: brian@other.host.net
.fi
.RE

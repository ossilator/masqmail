.TH rmail 8 @RELEASE_DATE@ "@PACKAGE_STRING@" "Maintenance Commands"

.SH NAME
rmail \- handle remote mail received via uucp


.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI @xsbindir@/rmail "recipient .\|.\|."


.SH DESCRIPTION

Rmail is a wrapper around masqmail.
It reads a mail message on standard input and passes it to masqmail's standard input.
Rmail only removes the first line from the input and constructs the return path from it.

Such a first line:

From user Wed Jan  9 12:43:35 1985 remote from host Date: 9 Jan 1985   8:39 EST

would generate this call to masqmail:

masqmail \-i \-f user@host \-\- bob@example.org

(If \(lqbob@example.org\(rq was the argument to the rmail call.)


.SH AUTHOR

.SH NAME
masqmail.conf \- masqmail configuration file


.SH DESCRIPTION

This man page describes the syntax of the main configuration file of masqmail.
Its usual location is
.IR @with_confdir@/masqmail.conf .

The configuration consists of lines of the form

.RS 8
.BI "var = " expression
.RE

Where
.B var
is a variable name and
.I expression
a string, which can be quoted with double quotes
.RB ( \(dq ).
If the expression is on multiple lines or contains characters other
than letters, digits, and the characters
.BR @ ", " / ", " \- ", " _ ", " . ", " : ", and " ; ,
it must be quoted.
You can use quotes inside quotes by escaping them with a backslash
.RB ( \e ),
which also quotes itself.

Each
.B var
has a type, which can be boolean, numeric, string or list.
A boolean variable can be assigned one of the values
.BR on ", " yes ", and " true
or
.BR off ", " no ", and " false .
List items are separated by semicolons
.RB ( ; ).
The spaces around the equal sign are optional.

To make specifying large lists more convenient, all list variables
(except
.BI query_routes. name
and
.BR permanent_routes )
accept inclusion statements in the form of absolute pathnames
as well; these can be intermixed with normal entries.
The contents of these files are included at their position in the list.
Within these files, each line is one entry; the semicolon is no separator.

Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
.RB ( # )
are ignored in both the config file and in included files.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI "run_as_user = " boolean

If this is set, masqmail runs with the user id of the user who
invoked it and never changes it.
This is for debugging purposes only.
If the user is not root, masqmail will not be able to listen on a port < 1024
and will not be able to deliver local mail to others than the user.

.TP
.BI "use_syslog = " boolean

If this is set, masqmail uses syslogd for logging.
It uses the facility
.BR MAIL .
Note that
.B log_dir
still needs to be set up.

.TP
.BI "debug_level = " n

Set the debug level.
Valid values are 0 to 6 and 9.
Be careful when you set this to 5 or higher, as the logs may grow big
very soon.
Level 9 also enables printing of debug messages to stderr while reading
the config file (the log files are not available at that time).

.TP
.BI "log_dir = " dir

The directory where logs are stored.
.B masqmail.log
is the main log, if syslog is not used.
.B debug.log
is a much more verbose log, which is created when debugging is enabled
.RB ( debug_level "\ >\ 0)."
.I dir
must be an absolute path.
The directory is created at startup if missing.

Default:
.I @with_logdir@

.TP
.BI "mail_dir = " dir

The directory where local mail is stored,
usually \fI/var/spool/mail\fR or \fI/var/mail\fR.
.I dir
must be an absolute path.

Default: \fI/var/mail\fR

.TP
.BI "spool_dir = " dir

The directory where masqmail stores its spool files
(and lock files if \fIrun_as_user\fP).
Masqmail needs read and write permissions for this directory.
.I dir
must be an absolute path.
The directory is created at startup if missing.

Default:
.I @with_spooldir@

.TP
.BI "lock_dir = " dir

The directory where masqmail stores its lock files.
Masqmail needs read and write permissions for this directory.
.I dir
must be an absolute path.
The default is
.I @with_lockdir@
for normal operation.
The directory is created on startup if yet missing.

If \fIrun_as_user\fP then lock files are stored in the \fIspool_dir\fP
directly and the \fBlock_dir\fP setting is ignored.

.TP
.BI "host_name = " string

This is used in different places: Masqmail identifies itself with this name
in the greeting banner of incoming connections, and in the HELO/EHLO command
for outgoing connections. It is also used in the \(lqReceived:\(rq header,
and to qualify the sender of locally originating messages.

If the string begins with a slash, it it assumed that it is a filename,
and the first line of this file will be used.
On Debian, this will usually be
.I /etc/mailname
to make masqmail conform to policy.

It is not (directly) used to find whether an address is local.
Use \fBlocal_hosts\fR for that.

Default: none; \fBhost_name\fP MUST be set in the config file

.TP
.BI "local_hosts = " list

A semicolon-separated list of hostnames which are considered local.
Can contain glob patterns, like
\(lq*example.org\(rq or \(lqmail?.*mydomain.net\(rq.
Normally. you should set it to \(lqlocalhost;foo;foo.bar.com\(rq
if your host has the fully qualified domain name \(lqfoo.bar.com\(rq.

Default: localhost ; <value of \fBhost_name\fR cut at the first dot> ;
<value of \fBhost_name\fR>

Example: \fIlocalhost;foo;foo.example.org\fR
(if you have set
.B host_name
to \(lqfoo.example.org\(rq)

.TP
.BI "local_addresses = " list

A semicolon-separated list of email addresses which are considered
local even though their domain name is not in
.BR local_hosts .

This list can be seen as an addition to
.BR local_hosts ,
and can be used if there are only a few additional addresses to be
considered local.

Entries lacking a domain name are qualified with
.BR host_name .

Example:

.RS 8
.nf
local_hosts = \(dqlocalhost;myhost\(dq
local_addresses = \(dqbob@somewhere;alice@foo\(dq
.fi
.RE
.IP

This will cause mail to bob@somewhere to go to bob@localhost,
if not redirected by an alias.

.TP
.BI "not_local_addresses = " list

A semicolon-separated list of email addresses which are considered
non-local even though their domain name is in
.BR local_hosts .

This list can be seen as a subtraction from
.BR local_hosts ,
and can be used if the majority of addresses in a specific domain are
to be considered local.

Entries lacking a domain name are qualified with
.BR host_name .

Example:

.RS 8
.nf
local_hosts = \(dqlocalhost;myhost;mydomain.net\(dq
not_local_addresses = \(dqeric@mydomain.net\(dq
.fi
.RE

.TP
.BI "listen_addresses = " list

A semicolon `;' separated list of interfaces on which connections will
be accepted.
An interface ist defined by a hostname, optionally followed by a colon `:'
and a number for the port.
If this is left out, port 25 will be used.

You can set this to "localhost:25;foo:25" if your hostname is `foo'.

Note that the names are resolved to IP addresses.
If your host has different names which resolve to the same IP,
use only one of them, otherwise you will get an error message.

Default: \fIlocalhost:25\fR (i.e. only local processes can connect)

.TP
.BI "do_save_envelope_to = " boolean

If this is set to true, a possibly existing Envelope-to: header in
an incoming mail which is received via either pop3 or smtp will be saved
as an X-Orig-Envelope-to: header.

This is useful if you retrieve mail from a pop3 server with fetchmail,
and the server supports Envelope-to: headers,
and you want to make use of those with a mail filtering tool, e.g. procmail.
It cannot be preserved because masqmail sets such a header by itself.

Default is false.

.TP
.BI "do_relay = " boolean

If this is set to false, mail with a return path that is not local
and a destination that is also not local will not be accepted via smtp
and a 550 reply will be given.
Default is true.

Note that this will not protect you from spammers using open relays,
but from users unable to set their address in their mail clients.
It also does NOT prevent masqmail from being an open relay itself,
as validity of the return path is not enforced.

.TP
.BI "do_queue = " boolean

If this is set, masqmail will not try to deliver mail
immediately when accepted.
Instead it will always queue it.
(Note: Masqmail will always automatically queue mail if necessary,
i.e. if it cannot deliver because no suitable route was available for example.)

Same as calling masqmail with the \fB\-odq\fR option.
Usually you should leave this option unset.

Default: false

.TP
.BI "permanent_routes = " list

Set this to the filename (or a semicolon-separated list of filenames)
of the route configuration for always available connections.

.TP
.BI query_routes. name " = " list

Replace \fIname\fR with a name to identify the connection.
Set this to a filename (or a semicolon-separated list of filenames)
for the route configuration for that connection.

Routes of this kind cannot be expected to be online always.
Masqmail will query which of the routes are online.

You can use the name to call masqmail with the \fB\-qo\fR option every time a
connection to your ISP is set up, in order to send queued mail through this 
route.

Example: Your ISP has the name FastNet.
Then you write the following line in the main configuration:

.RS 8
.nf
query_routes.FastNet = \(dq@with_confdir@/fastnet.route\(dq
.fi
.RE
.IP

.I @with_confdir@/fastnet.route
is the route configuration file, see
.MR masqmail.route 5 .
As soon as a link to FastNet has been set up,
you call `masqmail \fB\-qo \fIFastNet\fR'.
Masqmail will then read the specified file and send the mails.

See \fBonline_query\fP.

.TP
.BI "alias_file = " file

Set this to the location of your alias file.
If not set, no aliasing will be done.

Default: <not set> (i.e. no aliasing is done)

.TP
.BI "globalias_file = " file

Set this to the location of a glob-pattern alias file.
This kind of aliasing matches glob patterns against full email addresses,
not strings against local parts like in normal aliasing.
You can use this to handle catch-all maildrops (``*@example.org'')
and to split between virtual hosts on a single machine
(e.g. ``info@foo.ex.org'' and ``info@bar.ex.org'').

Glob aliasing is done before normal aliasing.
If you have both kinds, glob and normal aliasing, then the results of the
glob aliasing may be expanded further by the normal aliasing mechanism.

Default: <not set> (i.e. no glob aliasing is done)

.TP
.BI "caseless_matching = " boolean

If this is set, aliasing and the matching for \fBlocal_addresses\fP and
\fBnot_local_addresses\fP will be done caseless.

Note: Be sure to change this option only if the queue is empty as
correct processing of queued messages is not guaranteed otherwise.

Default: false

.TP
.BI "pipe_fromline = " boolean

If this is set, a from line will be prepended to the output stream whenever
a pipe command is called after an alias expansion.
Default is false.

.TP
.BI "pipe_fromhack = " boolean

If this is set, each line beginning with `From ' is replaced with `>From '
whenever a pipe command is called after an alias expansion.
You probably want this if you have set \fBpipe_fromline\fR above.
Default is false.

.TP
.BI "mbox_default = " string

The default local delivery method.
Can be mbox or mda.
You can override this for each user by using the \fBmbox_users\fR or
\fBmda_users\fR (see below).

Default: mbox.

.TP
.BI "mbox_users = " list

A list of users which wish delivery to an mbox style mail folder.

.TP
.BI "mda_users = " list

A list of users which wish local delivery to an mda.
You have to set \fBmda\fR (see below) as well.

.TP
.BI "mda = " command

If you want local delivery to be transferred to an mda (Mail Delivery Agent),
set this to a command.
The argument will be expanded on delivery time,
you can use variables beginning with a dolloar sign `$',
optionally enclosed in curly braces.
Variables you can use are:

.RS 8
.TP
uid
the unique message id.
(This is not necessarily identical with the Message ID
as given in the Message ID: header.)

.TP
received_host
the host the mail was received from

.TP
ident
the user id of the sender if the message was received locally.

.TP
return_path_local
the local part of the return path (sender).

.TP
return_path_domain
the domain part of the return path (sender).

.TP
return_path
the complete return path (sender).

.TP
rcpt_local
the local part of the recipient.

.TP
rcpt_domain
the domain part of the recipient.

.TP
rcpt
the complete recipient address.
.RE
.IP

Example:

.RS 8
mda="/usr/bin/procmail \-Y \-d ${rcpt_local}"
.RE
.IP

For the mda, as for pipe commands,
a few environment variables will be set as well.
See
.MR masqmail 8 .
To use environment variables for the mda,
the dollar sign `$' has to be escaped with a backslash,
otherwise they will be tried to be expanded with the internal variables.

.TP
.BI "mda_fromline = " boolean

If this is set, a from line will be prepended to the output stream whenever
a message is delivered to an mda.
Default is false.

.TP
.BI "mda_fromhack = " boolean

If this is set, each line beginning with `From ' is replaced with `>From '
whenever a message is delivered to an mda.
You probably want this if you have set \fBmda_fromline\fR above.
Default is false.

.TP
.BI "online_query = " command

Defines the method masqmail uses to detect whether there exists
an online connection currently.

Masqmail executes the command given and reads from its standard output.
The command should just print a route name, as defined
with \fBquery_routes.\fIname\fR, to standard output and return
a zero status code.
Masqmail assumes it is offline if the script returns with a non-zero status.
Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from the output.

Simple example:

.RS 8
.nf
#!/bin/sh
test \-e /var/tmp/masqmail-route || exit 1
cat /var/tmp/masqmail-route
exit 0
.fi
.RE
.IP

No matter how masqmail detects the online status,
only messages that are accepted at online time will be
delivered using the connection.
The mail spool still needs to be emptied manually
(\fB\-qo\fIconnection\fR).

\fIcommand line\fR must start with an absolute path to an executable program.
It can contain optional arguments.

To simulate the old online_method=file, use:

.RS 8
\fI/bin/cat /path/to/file\fP
.RE
.IP

To be always online with connection `foo', use:

.RS 8
\fI/bin/echo foo\fP
.RE
.IP

To query a masqdialer server
(i.e. asking it whether a connection exists and what its name is)
use:

.RS 8
\fI/usr/bin/mservdetect localhost 224\fP
.RE
.IP

.TP
.BI "errmsg_file = " file

Set this to a template which will be used to generate delivery failure reports.
Variable parts within the template begin with a dollar sign and are identical
to those which can be used as arguments for the mda command,
see \fBmda\fR above.
Additional information can be included with @failed_rcpts,
@msg_headers and @msg_body,
these must be at the beginning of a line and will be replaced
with the list of the failed recipients,
the message headers and the message body of the failed message.

Default is
.IR @xmmdatadir@/tpl/failmsg.tpl .

.TP
.BI "warnmsg_file = " file

Set this to a template which will be used to generate delivery warning reports.
It uses the same mechanisms for variables as \fBerrmsg_file\fR, see above.

Default is
.IR @xmmdatadir@/tpl/warnmsg.tpl .

.TP
.BI "warn_intervals = " list

Set this to a list of time intervals, at which delivery warnings
(starting with the receiving time of the message) shall be generated.

A warning will only be generated just after an attempt to deliver the mail
and if that attempt failed temporarily.
So a warning may be generated after a longer time,
if there was no attempt before.

Default is "1h;4h;8h;1d;2d;3d"

.TP
.BI "max_defer_time = " time

This is the maximum time,
in which a temporarily failed mail will be kept in the spool.
When this time is exceeded, it will be handled as a delivery failure,
and the message will be bounced.

The excedence of this time will only be noticed if the message
was actually tried to be delivered.
If, for example, the message can only be delivered when online,
but you have not been online for that time, no bounce will be generated.

Default is 4d (4 days)

.TP
.BI "log_user = " name

Replace \fIname\fR with a valid local or remote mail address.

If this option is set, then a copy of every mail,
that passes through the masqmail system will also be sent
to the given mail address.

For example you can feed your mails into a program like hypermail
for archiving purposes by placing an appropriate pipe command in
.MR masqmail.aliases 5 .

.TP
.BI "max_msg_size = " bytes

This option sets the maximum size in bytes masqmail will accept for delivery.
This value is advertised to the SMTP client by the `SIZE' message during SMTP
session setup.
Clients pretending to send, or actually send,
more than \fIbytes\fR will get a 552 error message.

A zero value disables the maximum size limit.

Default is 0 (= unlimited).

.TP
.BI "defer_all = " boolean

If set to true, masqmail replies with ``421 service temporarily unavailable''
to any SMTP request and shuts the connection down.
Note: This option is for debugging purposes only.

Default: false

.SH NAME
masqmail.conf \- masqmail configuration file


.SH DESCRIPTION

This man page describes the syntax of the main configuration file of masqmail.
Its usual location is
.IR @with_confdir@/masqmail.conf .

The configuration consists of lines of the form

.RS 8
.BI "var = " expression
.RE

Where
.B var
is a variable name and
.I expression
a string, which can be quoted with double quotes
.RB ( \(dq ).
If the expression is on multiple lines or contains characters other
than letters, digits, and the characters
.BR @ ", " / ", " \- ", " _ ", " . ", " : ", and " ; ,
it must be quoted.
You can use quotes inside quotes by escaping them with a backslash
.RB ( \e ),
which also quotes itself.

Each
.B var
has a type, which can be boolean, numeric, string or list.
A boolean variable can be assigned one of the values
.BR on ", " yes ", and " true
or
.BR off ", " no ", and " false .
List items are separated by semicolons
.RB ( ; ).
The spaces around the equal sign are optional.

To make specifying large lists more convenient, all list variables
(except
.BI query_routes. name
and
.BR permanent_routes )
accept inclusion statements in the form of absolute pathnames
as well; these can be intermixed with normal entries.
The contents of these files are included at their position in the list.
Within these files, each line is one entry; the semicolon is no separator.

Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
.RB ( # )
are ignored in both the config file and in included files.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI "run_as_user = " boolean

If this is set, masqmail runs with the user id of the user who
invoked it and never changes it.
This is for debugging purposes only.
If the user is not root, masqmail will not be able to listen on a port < 1024
and will not be able to deliver local mail to others than the user.

.TP
.BI "use_syslog = " boolean

If this is set, masqmail uses syslogd for logging.
It uses the facility
.BR MAIL .
Note that
.B log_dir
still needs to be set up.

.TP
.BI "debug_level = " n

Set the debug level.
Valid values are 0 to 6 and 9.
Be careful when you set this to 5 or higher, as the logs may grow big
very soon.
Level 9 also enables printing of debug messages to stderr while reading
the config file (the log files are not available at that time).

.TP
.BI "log_dir = " dir

The directory where logs are stored.
.B masqmail.log
is the main log, if syslog is not used.
.B debug.log
is a much more verbose log, which is created when debugging is enabled
.RB ( debug_level "\ >\ 0)."
.I dir
must be an absolute path.
The directory is created at startup if missing.

Default:
.I @with_logdir@

.TP
.BI "mail_dir = " dir

The directory where local mail is stored,
usually \fI/var/spool/mail\fR or \fI/var/mail\fR.
.I dir
must be an absolute path.

Default: \fI/var/mail\fR

.TP
.BI "spool_dir = " dir

The directory where masqmail stores its spool files
(and lock files if \fIrun_as_user\fP).
Masqmail needs read and write permissions for this directory.
.I dir
must be an absolute path.
The directory is created at startup if missing.

Default:
.I @with_spooldir@

.TP
.BI "lock_dir = " dir

The directory where masqmail stores its spool lock files.
Masqmail needs read and write permissions for this directory.
.I dir
must be an absolute path.
The default is
.I @with_lockdir@
for normal operation.
The directory is created at startup if missing.

If \fIrun_as_user\fP then lock files are stored in the \fIspool_dir\fP
directly and the \fBlock_dir\fP setting is ignored.

.TP
.BI "host_name = " string

This is used in different places: Masqmail identifies itself with this name
in the greeting banner of incoming connections, and in the HELO/EHLO command
for outgoing connections. It is also used in the \(lqReceived:\(rq header,
and to qualify the sender of locally originating messages.

If the string begins with a slash, it it assumed that it is a filename,
and the first line of this file will be used.
On Debian, this will usually be
.I /etc/mailname
to make masqmail conform to policy.

It is not (directly) used to find whether an address is local.
Use \fBlocal_hosts\fR for that.

Default: none; \fBhost_name\fP MUST be set in the config file

.TP
.BI "local_hosts = " list

A semicolon-separated list of hostnames which are considered local.
Can contain glob patterns, like
\(lq*example.org\(rq or \(lqmail?.*mydomain.net\(rq.
Normally. you should set it to \(lqlocalhost;foo;foo.bar.com\(rq
if your host has the fully qualified domain name \(lqfoo.bar.com\(rq.

Default: localhost ; <value of \fBhost_name\fR cut at the first dot> ;
<value of \fBhost_name\fR>

Example: \fIlocalhost;foo;foo.example.org\fR
(if you have set
.B host_name
to \(lqfoo.example.org\(rq)

.TP
.BI "local_addresses = " list

A semicolon-separated list of email addresses which are considered
local even though their domain name is not in
.BR local_hosts .

This list can be seen as an addition to
.BR local_hosts ,
and can be used if there are only a few additional addresses to be
considered local.

Entries lacking a domain name are qualified with
.BR host_name .

Example:

.RS 8
.nf
local_hosts = \(dqlocalhost;myhost\(dq
local_addresses = \(dqbob@somewhere;alice@foo\(dq
.fi
.RE
.IP

This will cause mail to bob@somewhere to go to bob@localhost,
if not redirected by an alias.

.TP
.BI "not_local_addresses = " list

A semicolon-separated list of email addresses which are considered
non-local even though their domain name is in
.BR local_hosts .

This list can be seen as a subtraction from
.BR local_hosts ,
and can be used if the majority of addresses in a specific domain are
to be considered local.

Entries lacking a domain name are qualified with
.BR host_name .

Example:

.RS 8
.nf
local_hosts = \(dqlocalhost;myhost;mydomain.net\(dq
not_local_addresses = \(dqeric@mydomain.net\(dq
.fi
.RE

.TP
.BI "listen_addresses = " list

A semicolon-separated list of interfaces on which connections will
be accepted.
An interface is defined by a hostname, optionally followed by a colon
.RB ( : )
and a number for the port.
If the latter is left out, port 25 will be used.

You can set this to \(lqlocalhost:25;foo:25\(rq if your hostname is
\(lqfoo\(rq.

Note that the names are resolved to IP addresses.
If your host has different names which resolve to the same IP,
use only one of them, as otherwise you will get an error message.

Default:
.I localhost:25
(i.e., only local processes can connect)

.TP
.BI "do_save_envelope_to = " boolean

If this is set to true, a possibly existing \(lqEnvelope-to:\(rq header
in an incoming mail which is received via SMTP will be saved as an
\(lqX-Orig-Envelope-to:\(rq header.

This is useful if you retrieve mail from a POP3 server with fetchmail,
the server supports \(lqEnvelope-to:\(rq headers,
and you want to make use of those with a mail filtering tool, e.g.,
procmail.
It cannot be preserved because masqmail sets such a header by itself.

Default is false.

.TP
.BI "do_relay = " boolean

If this is set to false, mail with a return path that is not local
and a destination that is also not local will not be accepted via SMTP
and a 550 reply will be given.
Default is true.

Note that this will not protect you from spammers using open relays,
but from users unable to set their address in their mail clients.
It also does NOT prevent masqmail from being an open relay itself,
as validity of the return path is not enforced.

.TP
.BI "do_queue = " boolean

If this is set, masqmail will not try to deliver mail
immediately when accepted.
Instead it will always queue it.
(Note: Masqmail will always automatically queue mail if necessary,
i.e., if it cannot deliver because no suitable route was available
for example.)

Same as calling masqmail with the \fB\-odq\fR option.
Usually you should leave this option unset.

Default: false

.TP
.BI "permanent_routes = " list

Set this to the filename (or a semicolon-separated list of filenames)
of the route configuration for always available connections.

.TP
.BI query_routes. name " = " list

Replace \fIname\fR with a name to identify the connection.
Set this to a filename (or a semicolon-separated list of filenames)
for the route configuration for that connection.

Routes of this kind cannot be expected to be online always.
Masqmail will query which of the routes are online.

You can use the name to call masqmail with the \fB\-qo\fR option every time a
connection to your ISP is set up, in order to send queued mail through this 
route.

Example: Your ISP has the name FastNet.
Then you write the following line in the main configuration:

.RS 8
.nf
query_routes.FastNet = \(dq@with_confdir@/fastnet.route\(dq
.fi
.RE
.IP

.I @with_confdir@/fastnet.route
is the route configuration file, see
.MR masqmail.route 5 .
As soon as a link to FastNet has been set up,
you call \(lqmasqmail\ \-qo\ FastNet\(rq.
Masqmail will then read the specified file and send the mails.

See \fBonline_query\fP.

.TP
.BI "alias_file = " file

Set this to the location of your alias file; see
.MR masqmail.aliases 5 .
If not set, no aliasing will be done, which is the default.

Aliasing causes messages to local recipients to be redirected.

.TP
.BI "globalias_file = " file

Set this to the location of a glob-pattern alias file; see
.MR masqmail.aliases 5 .
If not set, no aliasing will be done, which is the default.

Glob aliasing is done before normal aliasing.
If you have both kinds, glob and normal aliasing, then the results of the
glob aliasing may be expanded further by the normal aliasing mechanism.

.TP
.BI "caseless_matching = " boolean

If this is set, aliasing and the matching for \fBlocal_addresses\fP and
\fBnot_local_addresses\fP will be done caselessly.

Note: Be sure to change this option only while the queue is empty,
as the change may impair the delivery of queued messages.

Default: false

.TP
.BI "pipe_fromline = " boolean

If this is set, a \(lqFrom\ \(rq line will be prepended to the message
whenever a pipe command is called after an alias expansion.
Default is false.

.TP
.BI "pipe_fromhack = " boolean

If this is set, each line beginning with \(lqFrom\ \(rq is replaced
with \(lq>From\ \(rq whenever a pipe command is called after an alias
expansion.
You probably want this if you have set \fBpipe_fromline\fR above.
Default is false.

.TP
.BI "mbox_default = " string

The default local delivery method.
Can be
.B mbox
or
.BR mda .
You can override this for each user by using the \fBmbox_users\fR or
\fBmda_users\fR (see below).

Default: mbox

.TP
.BI "mbox_users = " list

A list of users which wish delivery to an mbox style mail folder.

.TP
.BI "mda_users = " list

A list of users which wish local delivery via an MDA.
You need to set \fBmda\fR (see below) as well.

.TP
.BI "mda = " command

If you want local delivery to be transferred to an MDA (Mail Delivery Agent),
set this to a command.
The command is expanded at delivery time;
you can use variables beginning with a dollar sign,
optionally enclosed in curly braces.
Variables you can use are:

.RS 8
.TP
uid
the unique message id.
(This is not necessarily identical to the id found in the
\(lqMessage-ID:\(rq header.)

.TP
received_host
the host the mail was received from

.TP
ident
the user id of the sender if the message was received locally.

.TP
return_path_local
the local part of the return path (sender).

.TP
return_path_domain
the domain part of the return path (sender).

.TP
return_path
the complete return path (sender).

.TP
rcpt_local
the local part of the recipient.

.TP
rcpt_domain
the domain part of the recipient.

.TP
rcpt
the complete recipient address.

.RE
.IP

Example:

.RS 8
mda=\(dq/usr/bin/procmail \-Y \-d ${rcpt_local}\(dq
.RE
.IP

For the MDA, as for pipe commands,
a few environment variables will be set as well.
See
.MR masqmail 8 .
To use environment variables for the mda,
the dollar sign `$' has to be escaped with a backslash,
otherwise they will be tried to be expanded with the internal variables.

.TP
.BI "mda_fromline = " boolean

If this is set, a \(lqFrom\ \(rq line is prepended to the message
whenever one is delivered via an MDA.
Default is false.

.TP
.BI "mda_fromhack = " boolean

If this is set, each line beginning with \(lqFrom\ \(rq is replaced
with \(lq>From\ \(rq whenever a message is delivered via an MDA.
You probably want this if you have set \fBmda_fromline\fR above.
Default is false.

.TP
.BI "online_query = " command

Defines the command masqmail uses to detect whether there exists
an online connection currently.

.I command
must start with an absolute path to an executable program.

Masqmail executes the command given and reads from its standard output.
The command should print a single route name (as defined by
.BI query_routes. name\c
) to standard output, and return a zero status code.
Masqmail assumes it is offline if the script returns with a non-zero status.
Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from the output.

Note that accepting new messages while a route is available
does not cause already queued messages to be automatically
delivered using that route \(em the queue needs to be emptied
separately (see the
.B \-q
options).

Simple example for a query script:

.RS 8
.nf
#!/bin/sh
test \-e /var/tmp/masqmail\-route || exit 1
cat /var/tmp/masqmail\-route
exit 0
.fi
.RE
.IP

To query a masqdialer server, use:

.RS 8
.nf
online_query = \(dq@xbindir@/mservdetect localhost 224\(dq
.fi
.RE

.TP
.BI "errmsg_file = " file

Set this to a template which will be used for generating delivery
failure reports.
Variable parts within the template begin with a dollar sign and are
identical to those which can be used in arguments to the MDA command,
see
.B mda
above.
Additional information can be included using @failed_rcpts,
@msg_headers, and @msg_body;
these must appear at the beginning of a line and will be replaced
with the list of failed recipients,
the message headers, and the message body of the failed message,
respectively.

Default is
.IR @xmmdatadir@/tpl/failmsg.tpl .

.TP
.BI "warnmsg_file = " file

Set this to a template which will be used for generating delivery
warning reports.
Works like
.BR errmsg_file ,
see above.

Default is
.IR @xmmdatadir@/tpl/warnmsg.tpl .

.TP
.BI "warn_intervals = " list

Set this to a list of time intervals (relative to the reception time
of the message), at which delivery warnings shall be generated.

A warning will be generated only right after a temporarily failing
attempt to deliver a mail.
Therefore, warnings may be delayed or entirely skipped if no deliveries
are attempted regularly.

Default is \(lq1h;4h;8h;1d;2d;3d\(rq

.TP
.BI "max_defer_time = " time

This is the maximum time for which a temporarily failed mail will be
kept in the queue.
When this time is exceeded, it will be handled as a delivery failure,
and the message will be bounced.

The passing of this time will be noticed only if an attempt at
deliverung the message is actually made.
If, for example, the message can be delivered only through a particular
route, no bounce will be generated until that route goes online.

Default is 4d (4 days)

.TP
.BI "log_user = " name

Replace \fIname\fR with a valid local or remote mail address.

If this option is set, then a copy of every mail
that passes through the masqmail system will also be sent
to the given mail address.

For example you can feed your mails into a program like hypermail
for archiving purposes by placing an appropriate pipe command in
.MR masqmail.aliases 5 .

.TP
.BI "max_msg_size = " bytes

This option sets the maximum size in bytes masqmail will accept for delivery.
This value is advertised to the SMTP client by the \(lqSIZE\(rq message
during SMTP session setup.
Clients trying to send bigger messages will get
\(lq552 Error: message too large\(rq responses.

A zero value disables the size limit, which is the default.

.TP
.BI "defer_all = " boolean

If set to true, masqmail replies with
\(lq421 service temporarily unavailable\(rq
to any SMTP request and shuts the connection down.
Note: This option is for debugging purposes only.

Default: false

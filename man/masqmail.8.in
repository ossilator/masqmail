.SH DESCRIPTION

Masqmail is a mail server designed for hosts that do not have
a permanent internet connection, e.g., portable devices and
those on home networks.
It supports dynamic choice of the delivery route
and sender address rewriting (\(lqmasquerading\(rq).
It replaces sendmail or other MTAs such as qmail or exim.


.SH OPERATION MODES

Masqmail operates in one of several modes.

The daemon mode has two flavors that may be,
and usually are, used in combination:
.TP
.B Daemon (listen)
.B \-bd
or invoked as
.B smtpd

Run as daemon.
Act as SMTP server and accept SMTP connections,
on port 25 if not configured differently.

This is normally used in the startup script at system boot,
together with
.BI \-q INTERVAL
(see below).

Alternatively, masqmail can be run from
.MR inetd 8
with the
.B \-bs
option.

.TP
.B Daemon (queue)
.BI \-q INTERVAL

Run as daemon.
Do regular queue runs at the specified time interval.
This is normally used together with
.B \-bd
(see above).

The interval is a numerical value followed by one
of the letters
.BR s ", " m ", " h ", " d ", and " w ,
which are interpreted as
seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks, respectively.
.br
Example:
.B \-q30m
.br
Combinations like
.BR \-q1h30m ,
which sendmail accepts, are not possible.

.P
Alternatively, at any time a single queue run can be started,
in one of two variations:

.TP
.B Single queue run (normal)
.B \-q
(without argument)
or invoked as
.B runq

Masqmail tries to deliver to addresses on the local host,
and also to remote ones if suitable routes are online.
That means, masqmail sends all queued mail it can.
Online detection is done with the configured
command (see
.B online_query
in
.MR masqmail.conf 5 ).

You may want to use this option to trigger queue runs from
.MR cron 8 .

.TP
.B Single queue run (only named route)
.BI "\-qo " NAME

Masqmail tries to deliver using only the specified online route.

The route configuration
.I NAME
is read, and queued mail
to matching remote recipients is sent.
(See
.BI query_routes. NAME
in the main config file.)

You may want to use this option in scripts that run as soon as a link
to the internet has been set up (e.g., ip-up).

.P
The other modes are simple ones:

.TP
.B Rebuild alias database
.B \-bi

A no-op for masqmail, just exit.
Old sendmail rebuilds its alias database when invoked with this option.
Masqmail reads directly from its alias file (see config option
.BR alias_file ),
and thus no database needs to be updated.

.TP
.B Accept messages
.BR \-bm ,
also the default mode

Accept a text message on stdin.
One will hardly use this switch, as it is the default mode of operation.

The command line options
.BR \-f ", " \-F ", " \-i / \-oi ", and " \-t
are used only in this mode.

.TP
.B Print queue
.B \-bp
or invoked as
.B mailq

Show the messages in the queue.

.TP
.B Stand-alone SMTP server
.B \-bs
or invoked as
.B in.smtpd

Act as an SMTP server by reading commands from stdin
and writing to stdout.
Some mailers (e.g. pine) use this option as an interface.
It can also be used to call masqmail from inetd.

.TP
.B Print version
.B \-bV
or if called without arguments

Print version information, then exit.

.TP
.B Queue manipulation mode
.B \-Mrm
or invoked as
.B mailrm

Remove given messages from the queue.
Privileged users may remove any message, other users only their own.
The message identifiers are listed when printing the queue
(see \fB\-bp\fR).

.P
The default mode:
.P
When no mode has been specified by either one of the above command line
options or by calling masqmail under a special name,
then the default mode
.B \-bm
(i.e., accept messages on stdin) is entered.
However, if neither address arguments are specified nor
.B \-t
is given, then mail cannot be sent,
hence something more useful is done:
.B \-bV
is assumed.


.SH OPTIONS

Since masqmail is intended to replace sendmail,
it uses the same command line options,
but not all of them are implemented.
The
.B \-qo
option is unique to masqmail.

.TP
.B \-\-

Not a \(lqreal\(rq option.
It means that all following arguments are not to be understood
as options, even if they begin with a leading dash.
Mutt is known to call sendmail with this option.

.TP
.B \-bd

\(lqDaemon (listen)\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.B \-bi

\(lqRebuild alias database\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.B \-bm

\(lqAccept message\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.B \-bp

\(lqPrint queue\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.B \-bs

\(lqStand-alone SMTP server\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.B \-bV

\(lqPrint version\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.BI "\-B " arg

\fIarg\fR is usually 8BITMIME.
Some mailers use this to indicate that the message contains characters > 127.
Masqmail is 8-bit clean and ignores this, so you do not have to recompile elm,
which is very painful ;-).
Note though that this violates some conventions:
masqmail does not convert 8 bit messages to any MIME format if it encounters
a mail server which does not advertise its 8BITMIME capability,
and masqmail does not advertise it, either.
This is the same practice as that of exim (but different from sendmail).

.TP
.BI "\-C " filename

Use another configuration file than
.IR @with_confdir@/masqmail.conf .
Useful for debugging purposes.
If not invoked by a privileged user, masqmail will drop all privileges
it usually acquires by being set-uid root.

.TP
.BI "\-d " number

Set the debug level.
This takes precedence over the value of
.B debug_level
in the configuration file.
Read the warning in the description of the latter.
Only root may set the debug level.

.TP
.BI "\-f " address

Set the return path address to \fIaddress\fR.
The default is the invoking user qualified with
.BR host_name .
Only root, the user mail, and anyone in the group mail
is allowed to override that.

The value is also used for the \(lqFrom:\(rq header if the message does
not already have a \(lqFrom:\(rq or \(lqSender:\(rq header.

.TP
.BI "\-F " string

If the message does not already have a \(lqFrom:\(rq or \(lqSender:\(rq
header, this value is used as the display name for the \(lqFrom:\(rq header.

.TP
.B \-i

Same as \fB\-oi\fR, see below.
Kept for compatibility.

.TP
.BI "\-Mrm " msgid.\|.\|.

\(lqQueue manipulation\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.B \-m

\(lqMe too.\(rq
This switch is ignored, as
masqmail never excludes the sender from any alias expansions.

\fB\-m\fP is an ancient alias for \fB\-om\fP.
Kept for compatibility.

.TP
.B \-odb

\(lqDeliver in Background.\(rq
Return immediately after receiving a message, and spawn a child process
to do the delivery asynchronously.

This makes each call faster, but if many calls are done in quick succession,
it is likely to delay mail delivery due to relays and receivers limiting
concurrent connections, causing the mails to be deferred.
It is more reliable to use
.B \-odq
instead, followed by a run with
.B \-q
(see below).

.TP
.B \-odq

\(lqDo Queueing.\(rq
Do not attempt to deliver immediately.
Any messages will be queued until the next queue running process picks them
up and delivers them.
You get the same (but global) effect by setting the do_queue option in
.IR @with_confdir@/masqmail.conf .

.TP
.B \-oi

Usually, a line consisting of only a dot character terminates the
message. To send a literal dot, two dots must be used.
This option disables this behavior.

The same as \fB\-i\fP.

.TP
.B \-oXXX

Any other switch starting with \(lq\-o\(rq is ignored.
This especially affects \-om, \-oem, and \-oee.

.TP
.B \-q

\(lqSingle queue run (normal)\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.BI \-q INTERVAL

\(lqDaemon (queue)\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.BI "\-qo " name

\(lqSingle queue run (only named route)\(rq mode. See above.

.TP
.B \-t

Read recipients from mail headers and add them to the ones specified on the
command line.
(Only \(lqTo:\(rq, \(lqCc:\(rq, and \(lqBcc:\(rq headers are regarded.)

.B WARNING: The behavior changed with version 0.3.1!

In earlier versions command line argument addresses were \(lqsubtracted\(rq
from header addresses.

The old behavior was similar to exim's and smail's.
The new behavior is similar to the one of current postfix versions,
which add the arguments to the set of header recipients.
(Earlier postfix failed in case of address arguments with \-t.)
Sendmail seems to behave differently, depending on the version.
See
.MR exim 8
for further information.

For masqmail the most simple approach has been taken.

As the behavior of \-t together with command line address arguments
differs among MTAs, one better avoids this corner case.


.SH ENVIRONMENT FOR PIPES AND MDAS

For security reasons, before any pipe command from an alias expansion
or an MDA is called, the environment variables will be completely
discarded and newly set up. These are:

SENDER, RETURN_PATH \(en the return path.

SENDER_DOMAIN \(en the domain part of the return path.

SENDER_LOCAL \(en the local part of the return path.

RECEIVED_HOST \(en the host the message was received from (unless local).

DOMAIN \(en the domain part of the (original) recipient.

LOCAL_PART, USER, LOGNAME \(en the local part of the (original) recipient.

MESSAGE_ID \(en the unique message id.
This is an internal ID, and is at most part of the \(lqMessage-ID:\(rq header.

QUALIFY_DOMAIN \(en the domain which will be appended to unqualified addresses.

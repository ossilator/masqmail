After seeing some really picky mail servers, I think about making
multiple route configuration per ISP, do be selected by the rcpt
domains. Wanted to do that anyway some time.

Later: Workaround: set the picky domains in non_allowd_rcpt_domains
and call masqmail -qo <name> again with another configuration, which
makes them happy.

I think these routes should also be used for SMTP deliveries on the
local_net. It would be much more straight forward. And then you can
define a smart host also for the local network.

There sholud be a way of telling MasqMail when it is connected, so
that a newly accepted mail can be delivered immediately. Ideas:

- a signal (sent from the ip-up script), the connection name as a file.
- demon listens on some port and a client tells it 'that' and 'whereto'
- demon checks for the existence of a file, content of file is connection name (easiest)
- demon calls some program from time to time that tells him
- demon asks mserver from time to time (not everybody uses it though, right?)

Okay, now that we deliver immediately when connected, the connection
name for the -qo option should be redundant (but it is still
required). In principle, I could remove it completely.

A long time since last release, I had not enough times. MM seems to be
pretty stable though...got very few bug reports, mostly configuration
errors.

I have begun to hack pop3 client support. Still thinking
about how this will be integrated to masqmail:
- could be a separate program (which uses and needs almost all modules from masqmail)
- or inetegrate it into masqmail. Could be called with a different
name (masqpop? masqfetch (other fetching capbilities may be
implemented... or narcistic: ollipop ;-))

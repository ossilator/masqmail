Howto link masqmail statically?
-------------------------------

With gcc (don't know anything about other compilers), you simply
build masqmail with:

	LDFLAGS=-static make -e


On Debian GNU/Linux, I received a bunch warnings of that kind:

	interface.o: In function `init_sockaddr':
	interface.c:55: warning: Using 'gethostbyname' in statically
	linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries
	from the glibc version used for linking

On NetBSD I no warnings were printed.

I don't have enough knowledge to tell the reasons and implications.
Maybe you can.

Distribution specific stuff
===========================

Debian
------

If you compile for Debian, do the configure with at least these options:

	./configure --with-liblockfile

(You might like to add `--enable-ident'.)

You can also build your own Debian package with

	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

You need to have fakeroot installed to do this. Or, as root, do:

	dpkg-buildpackage

However, you better have a look at the official masqmail package in
Debian.

	apt-get source masqmail

is your friend.



SuSE/Redhat
-----------

There are spec files for rpm creation on the website. You may have to
adjust these files.

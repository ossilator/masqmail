Since masqmail-0.2.22, documentation is maintained in troff (man page)
format directly. The old XML sources are no longer used.

The `old-manual' directory contains the old manual (as expected) and
html versions of man pages from that time (May/July 2000). The files
have been copied from the old project website.

There are installation instructions for various systems available. Some
of them are outdated and may not work anymore.

Howto report bugs
=================

All non-trivial software has bugs and so does masqmail.

If you discover a bug then please report it. Your bug reports are an
important help in improving masqmail.

Valuable bug report include the following information. The first two
are essential, the others can also be added on request.

- A good description of what you consider to be the bug.

- The version of masqmail that was used. (The output of: masqmail -bV).

- A description on how to reproduce it. This includes information on
  other software that is involved.

- The configuration files. These are probably the contents of
  /etc/masqmail/*. Don't forget to substitute confidential data with
  placeholders.

- The relevant log files. Have a look at the value of use_syslog and
  log_dir in masqmail.conf. If use_syslog is enabled, the files are
  probably some of /var/log/mail*. If you don't use syslog, then the
  files reside under the path assigned to log_dir, or by default in
  /var/log/masqmail/. Take care to substitute confidential data if you
  send debug files. (It's good to run masqmail with `-d 5' or `-d 6' to
  generate debugging data that may help to track down the bug.

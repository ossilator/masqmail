<h2>masqmail route configuration file</h2>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This man page describes the syntax of the route configuration files
of <a href="masqmail.8.html">masqmail</a>. Their usual locations are in <em>/etc/masqmail/</em>.</p>



<h2>Options</h2>



<p><b>protocol</b> = <em>string</em></p>

<p><em>string</em> can be one of 'smtp' or 'pipe', default is
'smtp'. If set to 'smtp', mail will be sent with the SMTP protocol to
its destination. If set to 'pipe', you also have to set 'pipe'
to a command, the message will then be piped to a program. See option 'pipe' below.</p>




<p><b>mail_host</b> = <em>string</em></p>

<p>This is preferably the mail server of your ISP. All outgoing
messages will be sent to this host which will distribute them to their
destinations. If you do not set this mails will be sent
directly. Because the mail server is probably 'near' to you, mail
transfer will be much faster if you use it.</p>
<p>You can optionally give a port number following the host name
and a colon, eg mail_host="mail.foo.com:25".</p>




<p><b>resolve_list</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>Specify the method how the domain of the server is resolved. Possible values are
dns_mx, dns_a, byname. For 'dns_mx', the domain is assumed to be an MX
pointer to a list of host names, these will be tried each in order
(lowest preference value first, equal preference values in random
order). For 'dns_a', the domain is assumed to be an A pointer. For
'byname', the library function <b>gethostbyname (3)</b> will be used.</p>
<p>The default is "dns_mx;dns_a;byname".</p>




<p><b>connect_error_fail</b> = <em>boolean</em></p>

<p>If this is set, a connection error will cause a mail delivery to
fail, ie. it will be bounced. If it is unset, it will just be defered.</p>
<p>Default is false. The reason for this is that masqmail is designed
for non permanent internet connections, where such errors may occur
quite often, and a bounce would be annoying.</p>
<p>For the default local_net route is is set to true.</p>




<p><b>helo_name</b> = <em>string</em></p>

<p>Set the name given with the HELO/EHLO command. If this is not
set, <b>host_name</b> from <em>masqmail.conf</em> will be used, if
the <b>do_correct_helo</b> option (see below) is unset.</p>




<p><b>do_correct_helo</b> = <em>boolean</em></p>

<p>If this is set, masqmail tries to look up your host name as it
appears on the internet and sends this in the HELO/EHLO command. Some
servers are so picky that they want this. Which is really
crazy. It just does not make any sense to lie about ones own identity,
because it can always be looked up by the server. Nobody should
believe in the name given by HELO/EHLO anyway. If this is not
set, <b>host_name</b> from <em>masqmail.conf</em> or as given with
the <b>helo_name</b> (see above) will be used.</p>




<p><b>do_pipelining</b> = <em>boolean</em></p>

<p>If this is set to false, masqmail will not use ESMTP PIPELINING, even
if the server announces that it is able to cope with it. Default is true.</p>
<p>You do not want to set this to false unless the mail setup on the
remote server side is really broken. Keywords: wingate.</p>




<p><b>allowed_mail_locals</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>This is a semicolon ';' separated list of local parts which will be
allowed to send mail through this connection. If unset
and <b>not_allowed_mail_locals</b> is also unset, all users are
allowed.</p>




<p><b>not_allowed_mail_locals</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>This is a semicolon ';' separated list of local parts which will be
not allowed to send mail through this connection. Local
parts in this list will not be allowed to use this route even if they
are part of <b>allowed_mail_locals</b> (see above).</p>




<p><b>allowed_return_paths</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>This is a semicolon ';' separated list of addresses. Messages which
have one one of these addresses as the return path will be used using
this route (if not also in <b>not_allowed_return_paths</b> or an item
in <b>not_allowed_mail_locals</b> matches).</p>
<p>Patterns containing '?' and '*' can be used. The special item "<>" matches
the null sender address (eg. failure notices or delivery notifications).</p>




<p><b>not_allowed_return_paths</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>This is a semicolon ';' separated list of addresses. Messages which
have one one of these addresses as the return path will not be used using
this route (even if also in <b>allowed_return_paths</b> or an item
in <b>allowed_mail_locals</b> matches).</p>
<p>Patterns containing '?' and '*' can be used. The special item "<>" matches
the null sender address (eg. failure notices or delivery notifications).</p>




<p><b>allowed_rcpt_domains</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>A list of recipient domains where mail will be sent to. This is for
example useful if you use this route configuration when connected to
another LAN via ppp. Patterns containing '?' and '*' can be used.</p>




<p><b>not_allowed_rcpt_domains</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>A list of recipient domains where mail will not be sent
to. This is for example useful if you send mail directly (<b>mail_host</b> is
not set) and you know of hosts that will not accept mail from you
because they use a dialup list (eg. <a href = "http://maps.vix.com/dul/">http://maps.vix.com/dul/</a>. If any domain
matches both <b>allowed_rcpt_domains</b> and <b>not_allowed_rcpt_domains</b>,
mail will not be sent to this domain. Patterns containing '?' and '*' can be used.</p>




<p><b>set_h_from_domain</b> = <em>string</em></p>

<p>Replace the domain part in 'From:' headers with this value. This
may be useful if you use a private, outside unknown address on your
local LAN and want this to be replaced by the domain of the address of
your email addrsss on the internet. Note that this is different to <b>
set_return_path_domain</b>, see below.</p>




<p><b>set_return_path_domain</b> = <em>string</em></p>

<p>Sets the domain part of the envelope from address. Some hosts check
whether this is the same as the net the connection is coming from. If
not, they reject the mail because they suspect spamming. It should be
a valid address, because some mail servers also check
that. You can also use this to set it to your usual address on the
internet and put a local address only known on your LAN in the
configuration of your mailer. Only the domain part will
be changed, the local part remains unchanged. Use <b>
map_return_path_addresses</b> for rewriting local parts.</p>




<p><b>map_h_from_addresses</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>This is similar to <b>set_h_from_domain</b>, but more flexible. Set
this to a list which maps local parts to a full RFC 822 compliant
email address, the local parts (the keys) are separated from
the addresses (the values) by colons (':').</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>map_h_from_addresses = "john: John Smith <jsmith@mail.academic.edu>;
charlie: Charlie Miller <cmiller@mx.commercial.com>"</p>
<p>You can use patterns, eg. * as keys.</p>




<p><b>map_h_reply_to_addresses</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>Same as <b>map_h_from_addresses</b>, but for the 'Reply-To:' header.</p>




<p><b>map_h_mail_followup_to_addresses</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>Same as <b>map_h_from_addresses</b>, but for the 'Mail-Followup-To:'
header. Useful when replying to mailing lists.</p>




<p><b>map_return_path_addresses</b> = <em>list</em></p>

<p>This is similar to <b>set_return_path_domain</b>, but more
flexible. Set this to a list which maps local parts to a full RFC 821
compliant email address, the local parts (the keys) are
separated from the addresses (the values) by colons
(':'). Note that this option takes RFC 821 addresses
while <b>map_h_from_addresses</b> takes RFC 822 addresses. The
most important difference is that RFC 821 addresses have no full
name.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>
map_return_path_addresses =
"john: <jsmith@mail.academic.edu>;
charlie: <cmiller@mx.commercial.com>"
</p>
<p>You can use patterns, eg. * as keys.</p>




<p><b>expand_h_sender_address</b> = <em>boolean</em></p>

<p>This sets the domain of the sender address as given by the Sender:
header to the same address as in the envelope return path address
(which can be set by either <b>set_return_path_domain</b> or <b>map_return_path_addresses</b>).
This is for mail clients (eg. Microsoft Outlook) which use this address as the sender
address. Though they should use the From: address, see RFC
821. If <a href="http://www.fetchmail.org">fetchmail</a> encounters an unqualified Sender:
address, it will be expanded to the domain of the pop server, which is
almost never correct. Default is true.</p>




<p><b>expand_h_sender_domain</b> = <em>boolean</em></p>

<p>Like <b>expand_h_sender_address</b>, but sets the domain only.
Deprecated, will be removed in a later version.</p>




<p><b>last_route</b> = <em>boolean</em></p>

<p>If this is set, a mail which would have been delivered using this
route, but has failed temporarily, will not be tried to be delivered
using the next route.</p>
<p>If you have set up a special route with filters using the lists
'allowed_rcpt_domains', 'allowed_return_paths', and
'allowed_mail_locals' or their complements (not_), and the mail
passing these rules should be delivered using this route only, you
should set this to 'true'. Otherwise the mail would be passed to the
next route (if any), unless that route has rules which prevent
that.</p>
<p>Default is false.</p>




<p><b>auth_name</b> = <em>string</em></p>

<p>Set the authentication type for ESMTP AUTH authentification.
Currently only 'cram-md5' and 'login' are supported.</p>




<p><b>auth_login</b> = <em>string</em></p>

<p>Your account name for ESMTP AUTH authentification.</p>




<p><b>auth_secret</b> = <em>string</em></p>

<p>Your secret for ESMTP AUTH authentification.</p>




<p><b>pop3_login</b> = <em>file</em></p>

<p>If your Mail server requires SMTP-after-POP, set this to a
get configuration (see <a href="masqmail.get.5.html">masqmail.get</a>).
If you login to the POP server
before you send, this is not necessary.</p>




<p><b>wrapper</b> = <em>command</em></p>

<p>If set, instead of opening a connection to a remote server, <em>command</em> will
be called and all traffic will be piped to its
stdin and from its stdout. Purpose is to tunnel ip traffic, eg. for ssl.</p>
<p>Example for ssl tunneling:</p>
<p>wrapper="/usr/bin/openssl s_client -quiet -connect pop.gmx.net:995 2>/dev/null"</p>




<p><b>pipe</b> = <em>command</em></p>

<p>If set, and protocol is set to 'pipe', <em>command</em> will be
called and the message will be piped to its stdin. Purpose is to use
gateways to uucp, fax, sms or whatever else.</p>
<p>You can use variables to give as arguments to the command, these
are the same as for the mda in the main configuration, see <a href="masqmail.conf.5.html">masqmail.conf</a>.</p>




<p><b>pipe_fromline = <em>boolean</em></b></p>

<p>If this is set, and protocol is set to 'pipe', a from line will be prepended to the output stream whenever
a pipe command is called. Default is false.</p>




<p><b>pipe_fromhack = <em>boolean</em></b></p>

<p>If this is set, and protocol is set to 'pipe', each line beginning with 'From '
is replaced with '>From ' whenever a pipe command is called. You probably want this if you have
set <b>pipe_fromline</b> above. Default is false.</p>

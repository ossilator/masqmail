<h2>masqmail alias file format</h2>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This man page describes the format of the masqmail alias file. Its usual location is <em>/etc/aliases</em>.</p>



<h2>File Format</h2>

<p>The alias file consists of lines of the form:</p>

local_part: item1, item2, ...


<p>Items can be surrounded by quotes '"'. If within the quotes other
quotes are needed for an address they can be escaped with a leading
backslash '\'.</p>

<p>A leading '\' indicates that this address shall not be further
expanded.</p>

<p>A leading pipe symbol '|' indicates that the item shall be treated
as a pipe command. The content of the message will then be sent to the
standard input of a command. The command will run under the user id
and group id masqmail is running as. If quotes are needed, the pipe
symbol must appear within the quotes.</p>

<p>Loops will be detected, the offending address will be ignored.</p>

<p>Aliases will be expanded at delivery time. This means that
if there is a message still in the queue and you change any alias
which matches one of the recipient addresses, the change will have
effect next time a delivery is attemped.</p>

<p>There is no need to restart masqmail or run any command when the
alias file has been changed.</p>

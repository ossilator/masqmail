<h2>Description</h2>

<p>MasqMail is a mail server designed for hosts that do
not have a permanent internet connection eg. a home network or a
single host at home. It has special support for connections to
different ISPs. It replaces sendmail or other MTAs such as qmail or
exim. It can also act as a pop3 client.</p>



<h2>Options</h2>

<p>Since masqmail is intended to replace sendmail, it uses the same
command line options, but not all are implemented. There are also two
additional options, which are unique to masqmail (-qo <em>connection</em> and -g)
</p>


<p><b>--</b></p>
<p>Not a 'real' option, it means that all following arguments are to
be understood as arguments and not as options even if they begin with a
leading dash '-'. Mutt is known to call sendmail with this option.</p>



<p><b>-bd</b></p>
<p>Run as daemon, accepting connections, usually on port 25 if not
configured differently. This is usually used in the startup script at system boot and
together with the -q option (see below).</p>



<p><b>-bi</b></p>
<p>Old sendmail rebuilds its alias database when invoked with this
option. Masqmail ignores it. Masqmail reads directly from the file
given with alias_file in the config file.</p>



<p><b>-bp</b></p>
<p>Show the messages in the queue. Same as calling masqmail as
'mailq'.</p>



<p><b>-bs</b></p>
<p>Accept SMTP commands from stdin. Some mailers (eg pine) use this
option as an interface. It can also be used to call masqmail from
inetd.</p>



<p><b>-B <em>arg</em></b></p>
<p><em>arg</em> is usually 8BITMIME. Some mailers use this
to indicate that the message contains characters > 127. Masqmail is
8-bit clean and ignores this, so you do not have to recompile elm,
which is very painful ;-). Note though that this violates some
conventions: masqmail does not convert 8 bit messages to any
MIME format if it encounters a mail server which does not advertise
its 8BITMIME capability, masqmail does not advertise this itself. This
is the same practice as that of exim (but different to
sendmail).</p>


<p><b>-bV </b></p>
<p>Show version information.</p>




<p><b>-C </b><em>filename</em></p>
<p>Use another configuration than <em>/etc/masqmail/masqmail.conf</em>. Useful for
debugging purposes. If not invoked by a privileged user, masqmail will drop all privileges.
</p>



<p><b>-d <em>number</em></b></p>

<p>Set the debug level. This takes precedence before the value of
debug_level in the configuration file. Read the warning in the
description of the latter.
</p>




<p><b>-f [<em>address</em>]</b></p>

<p>Set the return path address to <em>address</em>. Only root, the
user mail and anyoune in group trusted is allowed to do that.</p>




<p><b>-F [<em>string</em>]</b></p>

<p>Set the full sender name (in the From: header)
to <em>string</em>.</p>




<p><b>-g [<em>name</em>]</b></p>

<p>Get mail (using pop3 or apop), using the configurations given
with get.<em>name</em> in the main configuration. Without <em>name</em>,
all get configurations will be used. See also <a href="masqmail.get.5.html">masqmail.get</a></p>




<p><b>-go [<em>interval</em>] [<em>name</em>]</b></p>

<p>Can be followed by a connection name. Use this option in your
script which starts as soon as a link to the internet has been set up
(usually ip-up). When masqmail is called with this option, the
specified get configuration(s) is(are) read and mail will be
retrieved from servers on the internet.
The <em>name</em> is defined
in the configuration (see <b>online_gets.<em>name</em></b>).
</p><p>
If called with an interval option (recognized by a digit
as the first characater), masqmail starts as a daemon and tries to
get mail in these intervals. It checks for the online status first.
Example: masqmail -go 5m will retrieve mail
all five minutes.
</p><p>
If called without <em>name</em> the online status is determined with
the configured method (see <b>online_detect</b> in config.html).
</p>




<p><b>-i</b></p>
<p>Same as -oi, see below.</p>



<p><b>-Mrm <em>list</em></b></p>
<p>Remove given messages from the queue. Only allowed for privileged users.</p>



<p><b>-oem</b></p>
<p>If the -oi ist not also given, always return with a non zero
return code. Maybe someone tells me what this is good for...</p>



<p><b>-odb</b></p>
<p>Deliver in background. Masqmail always does this, which
makes this option pretty much useless.</p>



<p><b>-odq</b></p>
<p>Do not attempt to deliver immediately. Any messages will be queued
until the next queue running process picks them up and delivers
them. You get the same effect by setting the do_queue option in
/etc/masqmail/masqmail.conf.</p>



<p><b>-oi</b></p>
<p>A dot as a single character in a line does not terminate
the message.</p>



<p><b>-q [<em>interval</em>]</b></p>
<p>If not given with an argument, run a queue process, ie. try to
deliver all messages in the queue. Masqmail sends only to those
addresses that are on the local net, not to those that are
outside. Use -qo for those.</p>
<p>
If you have configured inetd to start masqmail, you can use this
option in a cron job which starts in regular time intervals, to mimic
the same effect as starting masqmail with -bd -q30m.
</p><p>
An argument may be a time interval ie. a numerical value followed
by one of the letters. s,m,h,d,w which are interpreted as seconds,
minutes, hours, days or weeks respectively. Example: -q30m. Masqmail
starts as a daemon and a queue runner process will be started
automatically once in this time interval. This is usually used
together with -bd (see above).
</p>




<p><b>-qo [<em>name</em>]</b></p>

<p>Can be followed by a connection name. Use this option in your
script which starts as soon as a link to the internet has been set up
(usually ip-up). When masqmail is called with this option, the
specified route configuration is read and the queued mail with
destinations on the internet will be sent. The <em>name</em> is defined
in the configuration (see <b>online_routes.<em>name</em></b>).
</p><p>
If called without <em>name</em> the online status is determined with
the configured method (see <b>online_detect</b> in config.html)
</p>




<p><b>-t</b></p>
<p>Read recipients from headers. Delete 'Bcc:' headers. If any
arguments are given, these are interpreted as recipient addresses and
the message will not be sent to these.</p>



<p><b>-v</b></p>
<p>Log also to stdout. Currently, some log messages are
marked as 'write to stdout' and additionally, all messages with
priority 'LOG_ALERT' and 'LOG_WARNING' will be written to stdout
if this option is given. It is disabled in daemon mode.
</p>




<h2>Environment for pipes and mdas</h2>


<p>For security reasons, before any pipe command from an alias
expansion or an mda is called, the environment variables will be
completely discarded and newly set up. These are:</p>
<p>SENDER, RETURN_PATH - the return path.</p>
<p>SENDER_DOMAIN - the domain part of the return path.</p>
<p>SENDER_LOCAL - the local part of the return path.</p>
<p>RECEIVED_HOST - the host the message was received from (unless local).</p>
<p>LOCAL_PART, USER, LOGNAME - the local part of the (original) recipient.</p>
<p>MESSAGE_ID - the unique message id. This is not necessarily identical with the Message ID as given in the Message ID: header.</p>
<p>QUALIFY_DOMAIN - the domain which will be appended to unqualified addresses.</p>




<h2>Files</h2>

<p><em>/etc/masqmail/masqmail.conf</em> is the main configuration
for masqmail. Depending on the settings in this file, you will also
have other configuration files in <em>/etc/masqmail/</em>.</p>
<p><em>/etc/aliases</em> is the alias file, if not set differently
in <em>/etc/masqmail/masqmail.conf</em>.</p>
<p><em>/var/spool/masqmail/</em> is the spool directory where masqmail
stores its spooled messages and the uniq pop ids.</p>
<p><em>/var/spool/mail/</em> is the directory where locally delivered mail will be put, if not configured differently in <em>masqmail.conf</em>.</p>
<p><em>/var/log/masqmail/</em> is the directory where masqmail stores
its log mesages. This can also be somewhere else if configured
differently by your sysadmin or the package mantainer.</p>

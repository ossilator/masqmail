<p>Since masqmail is intended to replace sendmail, it uses the same
command line options, but not all are implemented. There are also two
additional options, which are unique to masqmail (-qo
&lt;connection&gt; and -g) </p>

<b>-- </b>option:<br>

<p>Not a 'real' option, it means that all following arguments are to
be understood as arguments and not as options even if they begin with a
leading dash '-'. Mutt is known to call sendmail with this option.</p>

<b>-bd </b>option (daemon):<br>

<p>Run as daemon, accepting connections, usually on port 25 if not
configured differently. This is usually used in the startup script and
together with the -q option (see below).</p>

<b>-bi </b>option:<br>

<p>Old sendmail rebuilds its alias database when invoked with this
option. Masqmail ignores it. Masqmail reads directly from the file
given with <b>alias_file</b> in the config file.</p>

<b>-bp </b>option:<br>

<p>Show the messages in the queue. Same as calling masqmail as
'mailq'.</p>

<b>-bs </b>option:<br>

<p>Accept SMTP commands from stdin. Some mailers (eg pine) use this
option as an interface. It can also be used to call masqmail from
inetd, according to Tomislav Filipcic this works.</p>

<b>-B&lt;arg&gt;</b>option:<br>

<p>arg is usually 8BITMIME. Some mailers use this to indicate that the
message contains characters &gt; 127. Masqmail is 8-bit clean and
ignores this, so you do not have to recompile elm, which is very
painful ;-). Note though that this violates some conventions: masqmail
<em>does not</em> convert 8 bit messages to any MIME format if it
encounters a mail server which does not advertise its 8BITMIME capability,
masqmail does not advertise this itself. This is the same practice as
that of exim (but different to sendmail).</p>

<p>This <em>may</em> change in the future, but do not rely on it.</p>

<b>-C&lt;filename&gt;</b>option:<br>

<p>Use another configuration than /etc/masqmail.conf. Useful for
debugging purposes.</p>

<b>-d &lt;number&gt; </b>option:<br>

<p>Set the debug level. This takes precedence before the value of
<b>debug_level</b> in the configuration file. Read the warning in the
description of the latter.</p>

<b>-g </b>option:<br>

<p>Get mail, using the configurations given with
<b>get.&lt;name&gt;</b> in the main configuration.</p>

<b>-i </b>option:<br>

<p>Same as <b>-oi</b>, see below.</p>

<b>-oem </b>option:<br>

<p>If the <b>-oi</b> ist not also given, always return with a non zero
return code. Maybe someone tells me what this is good for... </p>

<b>-odb </b>option:<br>

<p>Deliver in background. Masqmail always does this.</p>

<b>-odq </b>option:<br>

<p>Do not attempt to deliver immediately. Any messages will be queued
until the next queue running process picks them up and delivers
them. You get the same effect by setting the <i>do_queue</i> option in
/etc/masqmail.conf.</p>

<b>-oi </b>option:<br>

<p>A dot as a single character in a line does <em>not</em> terminate
the message.</p>

<b>-q </b>option:<br>

<p>If not given with an argument, run a queue process, ie. try to
deliver all messages in the queue. Masqmail sends only to those
addresses that are on the <em>local</em> net, not to those that are
outside. Use -qo &lt;connection&gt; for those.</p>

<p>If you have configured inetd to start masqmail, you can use this
option in a cron job which starts in regular time intervals, to mimic
the same effect as starting masqmail with -bd -q30m.</p>

<p>An argument may be a time interval ie. a numerical value followed
by one of the letters. s,m,h,d,w which are interpreted as seconds,
minutes, hours, days or weeks respectively. Example: -q30m. Masqmail
starts as a daemon and a queue runner process will be started
automatically once in this time interval. This is usually used
together with -bd (see above).</p>

<b>-qo&lt;name&gt; </b>option:<br>

<p>Can be followed by a connection name. Use this option in your
script which starts as soon as a link to the internet has been set up
(usually ip-up). When masqmail is called with this option, the
specified route configuration is read and the queued mail with
destinations on the internet will be sent. The <b>name</b> is defined
in the configuration (see <b>connect_route.&lt;name&gt;</b>).</p>

<p>If called without &lt;name&gt, the online status is determined with
the configured method (see <b>online_detect</b> in <a
href="config.html">config.html</a>)</p>

<b>-t </b>option:<br>

<p>Read recipients from headers. Delete 'Bcc:' headers. If any
arguments are given, these are interpreted as recipient addresses and
the message will <em>not</em> be sent to these.</p>

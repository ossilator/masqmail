Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Some of these questions were never asked, but I thought they will
be some time. Some were asked.


When do I need MasqMail?
------------------------
You do not *need* it. But it makes sending mails via a dialup
connection a lot easier.

Unlike nullmailer, ssmtp, esmtp, etc., it is a "proper" MTA which
can also deliver local mail, and defer delivery in case of temporary
failure, for example due to being offline.

It supports easily configurable address rewriting (masquerading).

It supports multiple delivery route configurations, which are selected
dynamically. The choice can be made dependent on the provider you are
currently connected to, which may be useful on mobile devices. It is
also possible to select based on the sender and recipients of each
message, which is useful for having different users use different
smarthost configurations, and rewriting addresses only when a recipient
is outside your LAN.


When do I not need MasqMail?
----------------------------
The use of MasqMail is *strongly* discouraged if you have a
permanent connection to the internet without a firewall. First
because it does not have the ability to block relaying (it relays
every mail) and second because there are no capabilities to
protect against SPAM. You will not take advantages of its features
anyway.


Is there a mailing list for MasqMail?
-------------------------------------
No, use the discussion board on the GitHub project page.


After starting masmail, I get the following message: "could
not gain root privileges. Is the setuid bit set?"
-----------------------------------------------------------
Set the set-user-id-bit with chmod u+s /usr/sbin/masqmail.


After starting masmail, I get the following message: "bind:
Address already in use"
-----------------------------------------------------------
This means that there is already a process listening on a port,
usually 25. You either have another MTA running in the background
(sendmail, exim, etc.) or another instance of MasqMail.

It may also mean that the ports you configured MasqMail to listen on
(with 'listen_addresses') are on the same IP address, e.g., you may
have made your hostname resolve to 127.0.0.1 (which is localhost).
Do not do that.


When using online_query, I get the following message in
the log file: "route list with name '<name>' not found.".
-----------------------------------------------------------
Check whether the name returned by the command is really identical
to name you gave to the route configuration (case sensitive!).


I found a bug.
--------------
Report it to the project's issue tracker on GitHub, but first
make sure that you are using the newest version found on the
GitHub project page, and search the existing issues.


I think I found a bug, but I am not sure whether I configured
MasqMail incorrectly.
-------------------------------------------------------------
You can ask on the discussion board first, but it is not a big
deal if your bug report turns out to be a configuration issue.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Some of these questions were never asked, but I thought they will
be some time. Some were asked.


When do I need MasqMail?
------------------------
You do not *need* it. But it makes sending mails via a dialup
connection a lot easier.

It is useful if you dial to the internet from time to time via a
modem and connect to different providers, each one with a
different configuration. Other MTAs are not flexible enough if you
have to send mails via different mail servers for each provider.
With MasqMail you can configure a different one for each provider
and even set your return addresses differently.

It is also useful if you have a LAN with a gateway which is
connected to the internet via a modem because you can rewrite your
address depending on whether the recipients are *inside* or
*outside* your LAN. So responses and delivery failures on your LAN
will be sent to you without leaving it, while those outside will
be delivered to your address outside. (But it does not yet send
delivery failures itself yet.)

MasqMail is also often used on notebooks.


When do I not need MasqMail?
----------------------------
The use of MasqMail is *strongly* discouraged if you have a
permanent connection to the internet without a firewall. First
because it does not have the ability to block relaying (it relays
every mail) and second because there are no capabilities to
protect against SPAM. You will not take advantages of its features
anyway.


Is there a mailing list for MasqMail?
-------------------------------------
No, use the discussion board on the GitHub project page.


After starting masmail, I get the following message: "could
not gain root privileges. Is the setuid bit set?"
-----------------------------------------------------------
Set the set-user-id-bit with chmod u+s /usr/sbin/masqmail.


After starting masmail, I get the following message: "bind:
Address already in use"
-----------------------------------------------------------
This means that there is already a process listening on a port,
usually 25. You either have another MTA running in the background
(sendmail, exim, etc.) or another instance of MasqMail.

It may also mean that the ports you configured MasqMail to listen on
(with 'listen_addresses') are on the same IP address, e.g., you may
have made your hostname resolve to 127.0.0.1 (which is localhost).
Do not do that.


My friends told me that they do not see my full name in their
inbox, although it is configured in my mail client.
-------------------------------------------------------------
You probably used the map_h_from_addresses feature in the route
configuration and forgot to set your real name. The syntax is:

map_h_from_addresses = "charlie:Charlie Miller <cmiller@foo.com>";

Do not forget the Charlie Miller.


When using online_query, I get the following message in
the log file: "route list with name '<name>' not found.".
-----------------------------------------------------------
Check whether the name returned by the command is really identical
to name you gave to the route configuration (case sensitive!).


I found a bug.
--------------
Report it to the project's issue tracker on GitHub, but first
make sure that you are using the newest version found on the
GitHub project page, and search the existing issues.


I think I found a bug, but I am not sure whether I configured
MasqMail incorrectly.
-------------------------------------------------------------
You can ask on the discussion board first, but it is not a big
deal if your bug report turns out to be a configuration issue.

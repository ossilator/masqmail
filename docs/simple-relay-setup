Simple Setup
============

You want
--------

- submit mail on stdin by calling masqmail on the commandline
- submit mail with SMTP from the local machine
- let masqmail deliver mail locally to the system mailboxes /var/mail/*
- let masqmail forward non-local mail through a smart host

This is like the simple-local-setup plus the forwarding.


Set up
------

Follow the description in INSTALL.

Most times it's simply:

    ./configure


Configuration
-------------

You need a config file like this one:

    host_name = "foo.example.org"
    query_routes.default = /etc/masqmail/default.route

(Substitute a real hostname, of course.)

Addionally you need to create the route config file like:

    # where to relay to; the address and port of the smart host
    mail_host = "mail.gmx.net:25"
    # use a wrapper to enable encryption
    # for STARTTLS on port 25:
    #instant_helo=true
    #wrapper="/usr/bin/openssl s_client -quiet -starttls smtp -connect mail.gmx.net:25 2>/dev/null"
    # for SMTP over SSL on port 465:
    #wrapper = "/usr/bin/openssl s_client -quiet -connect mail.gmx.net:465 2>/dev/null"
    
    do_correct_helo = true
    
    # rewrite the From addresses to ones visible from the outside
    map_return_path_addresses = "meillo: schnalke4@gmx.de"
    map_h_from_addresses = "meillo: markus schnalke <schnalke4@gmx.de>"
    
    # it's good to use "login" only if the connection is encrypted
    auth_name = "login"
    #auth_name = "cram-md5"
    auth_login = "UID_OR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
    auth_secret = "PASSWORD"



Starting the daemon
-------------------

Listening for SMTP connections on a port requires masqmail to run as
daemon. You probably want to start masqmail as daemon each time the
system comes up. How you have to do that is system dependent.
/etc/rc.local is a good try to add the daemon call, because this file
seems to be frequently available.

    /usr/local/sbin/masqmail -bd -q10m

This starts masqmail in daemon mode and does a queue run every ten
minutes.


Check the setup
---------------

Like in simple-local-setup plus ...

Send a mail to a remote location:

    $ echo "some text" | mail foo@somewhereelse.example.org

Check if it is queued:

    $ masqmail -bp

Deliver it with:

    $ masqmail -qo default

Check the queue contents again.

You need to do such queue runs for online routes explicitely. For
instance by cron.


Automatic queue runs
--------------------

You can also tell masqmail to send queued mails through a route each
time the daemon does a queue run. Therefor you need to tell masqmail
that it is online and can use the default route to deliver mail.

Add this to masqmail.conf:

    online_query = "/bin/echo default"

Now masqmail will send online mail automatically through the default
route, each time it does a queue run (every ten minutes).


In case of problems
-------------------

Have a look at the log file: /var/log/masqmail/masqmail.log

Set the debug level in masqmail.conf, restart the daemon, redo the
test, and look at the debug file: /var/log/masqmail/debug.log

If you use a wrapper, test it manually and interactively on the
command line.

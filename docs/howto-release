How to do a masqmail release
============================


This document helps me to not forget any steps and to document how I
did it for any new maintainer who might come after me.


(1) Be sure that the current state of the project is ready to
release. Test if it compiles. Test if it works. Run the autotests.

(2) Update NEWS based on the VCS log. Check if contributions from
others are acknowledged adequately in THANKS.

(3) Is everything checked in and pushed out?


Now we should be ready to release.


(4) Add a version tag to the VCS.

(5) Run autoconf to transfer the change to the configure script.

(6) Run `make dist-sign'. A tarball and a detached GPG signature will
be created (this requires GnuPG with a secret key), and a test build
from the tarball is automatically performed.

(7) Check that the tarball contains everything it should.


Let's release.


(8) Publish the VCS tag.

(9) Create a release on GitHub.

(10) Post a release announcement to the discussion board.
It should include:
- a link to the release
- a brief summary of visible changes
- a versioned link to NEWS


Done.


Enjoy the day.  :-)

How to do a masqmail release
============================
meillo 2010-12-09


This document helps me to not forget any steps and to document how I
did it for any new maintainer who might come after me. This document
was inspired by docs/README.developers of the nmh project.


(1) Be sure that the current state of the project is ready to
release. Test if it compiles. Test if it works (this should be done
automatically with a better test suite).

(2) Update ChangeLog and NEWS based on the VCS log. Don't forget to
update the time of the ChangeLog entry. Check if contributions from
others are acknowledged adequately (ChangeLog, THANKS).

(3) Remove the -dev suffix from the version number in configure.ac. Run
autoconf afterwards to transfer the change to the configure script. Build
masqmail and run it with -bV to check the version.

(4) Run devel/list-versions and devel/update-manpage-date afterwards to
have the right version and date in the man pages.

(5) Is everything checked in?

(6) Run `make distclean', check for remaining files (just in case). `hg
st' is helpful. Build anew: `./configure ... && make && sudo make
install'. Check if everything went well. If so, `make distclean again'.


Now we should be ready to release.


(7) Run `devel/gen-release ../masqmail-0.x.y.tar.gz'. An md5sum will
be generated automatically and a detached gpg signature will be created
(this requires gnupg with a secret key).

(8) Unpack the generated tarball and examine its contents (-t or
-xv). Build masqmail anew from the tarball, see (6).

(9) Check the md5sum and the signature.


Let's release.


(10) Upload the tarball, the md5sum and the signature to the website.

(11) Write a release announcement to the mailing list. Preferably, the
announcement should contain the MD5 hash generated above, and should be
PGP-signed. It should include the URL for the tarball as well as the URL
of the website. It should contain a brief summary of visible changes, as
well as the URL of the webpage that would show a detailed list of changes.

(12) Submit a release info to freshmeat.net.

(13) Add a version tag to the VCS.

(14) Change the version number in configure.ac: Increment it and add
-dev to it. Run autoconf afterwards to propagate the change.


Done.


Enjoy the day.  :-)

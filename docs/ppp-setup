This document covers dial-up internet connections with PPP
----------------------------------------------------------

Now you have to set up the online configuration. The trick is to tell
your ip-up script the connection name. You could use the IP number of
the far side of the ppp link, but this is a pain and may change each
time. But you can give it an additional argument via pppd with ipparam.
Somewhere in your dial up script you have a line similar to:

	/usr/sbin/pppd /dev/ttyS1 connect "/usr/sbin/chat -t 90 -f $CHATFILE" \
	-d -d -d user user@somewhere file "$OPTIONS"

Just add 'ipparam FastNet' in the command line for pppd if your ISP has
the name FastNet. The ip-up script will then get 'FastNet' as a sixth
parameter. In your ip-up script you can then call masqmail with

	/usr/local/sbin/masqmail -qo "$6"

instead of 'sendmail -q', if you had that in the script before.
Masqmail will then read the route configuration specified for the
connection name 'FastNet' and deliver the mail destined to the internet.
See the configuration manual on how to write a route configuration or
use one of the examples as a template.

I do not know how do configure that for an ISDN adapter, but I am sure
you will find something similar in the man pages.

If you want mail that is received by masqmail from your local net to be
delivered immediately using the route configuration, you have two
possibilities:

* if you are using the masqdialer system, you just have to set the
  variables online_detect to pipe and online_pipe to something like
	/usr/bin/mservdetect localhost 224
  if mserver is running on localhost and listens on port 224. See the
  man page to mservdetect(1).

* otherwise you have to add two commands in your ip-up script:
	echo "$6" >/var/run/masqmail/masqmail-route
	chmod 644 /var/run/masqmail/masqmail-route
  and you have to remove the file /var/run/masqmail/masqmail-route in
  your ip-down script:
	rm /var/run/masqmail/masqmail-route
  Then you have to set online_detect to file and online_file to
  /var/run/masqmail/masqmail-route

See the route documentation for more.

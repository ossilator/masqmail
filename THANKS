I would like to thank everyone who has submitted suggestions and bug
reports. Special thanks to:

mail immediately when online. And for supplying a patch which made
masqmail work with mutt. And again for making the Debian package. And
more patches.

Dale Perkel for patiently trying to make MM compile and run with libc5
and various bug reports.

Andre Masloch for finding most bugs.

Edouard G. Parmelan for many patches and bug reports.

Iain Lea for the Redhat spec file.

Juergen Daubert for excellent bug reports including patches and various
feedback.

server-side SMTP SIZE support.

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Mar 2002 09:53:43 +0100

masqmail (0.1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version: bug fixes:
    - PowerPC fix for varargs functions
    - g_free fix in src/conf.c

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Dec 2001 18:02:29 +0100

masqmail (0.1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    this is a security fix release. When an alias expansion expands to a 
    pipe, only the effective uid was changed to mail, but not the real uid.
    This way, a command could gain root privileges. This is no longer 
    possible, masqmail drops prvileges completely before executing the pipe
    command (closes: #102092).
  * src/conf.c: Correct a typo (bugfix from upstream). Maybe this fixes the
    spurious segfault on m68k (#100594).
  * Add a dependency on netbase (closes: #101273).
  * Don't install the example configuration file for masqmail.conf in
    /etc/masqmail/, it's available in /usr/share/doc/masqmail/examples
    (closes: #101457).

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Jul 2001 22:57:13 +0200

masqmail (0.1.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - correct error reply for lacking permissions (closes: #92894,
      was already fixed in 0.1.13-2).
    - fixed 'last line missing' bug
    - fixed spool locking bug: lock was deleted if unsuccessful
      (unlocking it)

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Apr 2001 21:09:51 +0200

masqmail (0.1.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change priority from optional to extra.

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Apr 2001 16:07:36 +0200

masqmail (0.1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - qualify address for get configuration.
    - better checking for valid From: address when retrieving mail via pop3
      and this is used as the return path.

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Mar 2001 23:09:06 +0200

masqmail (0.1.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version e.g.:

    - an MDA for local mail delivery can be used
    - bug fixes

    For a complete list of changes since 0.1.7, see changelog and NEWS.

  * Add a patch by Edouard G. Parmelan <egp@free.fr>:
    - run daemon in queue mode.
    - add support for PPP and PCMCIA startup scripts.
    - add /etc/logrotate.d script.
    - suggests logrotate.

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Mar 2001 21:31:31 +0100

masqmail (0.1.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add debhelper to Build-Depends (closes: #76380).

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Nov 2000 20:59:16 +0100

masqmail (0.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version: 
  
    - debug option can be changed for privileged users only
    - fixed a security hole: -C option for unprivileged users now implies
      run_as_user and drops _all_ privileges
    - environment variables for pipe transport
    - wildcards for map_* options
    - rearranged interface handling, IP addresses now possible for
      listen_addresses and mserver_iface
    - beautified masqmail.c
    - revised uid and gid settings in spool.c and local.c (pipe transport)
    - optionally use ident protocol (RFC 1413) and store user id in
      spool file
    - proper spool file locking

  * i.e. the new upstream version includes fixes for the security problems
    tackled in 0.1.6-2.
  * We have compiled with libident support (--enable-ident).

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Oct 2000 09:37:56 +0200

masqmail (0.1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Security bugfix: An unprivileged user could use masqmail -C' 
    (use alternative configuration file) and/or -d' (enable debug output)
    for exploits. We disable these options for non-privileged users 
    (#74422 will be closed by the upload of 0.0.12-3 to stable).

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Oct 2000 20:42:04 +0200

masqmail (0.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:

    - MasqMail can now retrieve mail with pop3 (new option -g)
    - also supports SMTP after POP
    - supports ESMTP AUTH as client (only CRAM-MD5 supported for now)
    - `-qo' without a connection name works now
    - new command line option `-Mrm' to remove mails from queue
    - many bug fixes, e.g.
      - fixed the segfault caused by unqualified recipient addresses
        (closes: #69112)
    - documentation in html format has been removed; instead, there's
      a complete set of man pages.

    For a complete list of new features and bugs fixed since 0.0.12, please
    refer to the changelog file.

  * Include Build-Dependencies (closes: #65514).
  * Compiled with POP3 and AUTH support.
  * Fixed a typo in example.route: must be "pop3_login" (not pop_login).
  * configuration file masqmail.conf has been moved into /etc/masqmail/.

masqmail (0.0.12-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Just found and fixed another important bug: newaliases (aka
    masqmail -bi) would hang infinitely and therefore break postinst
    scripts of various packages. A very small fix in src/masqmail.c.

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Mar 2000 23:34:38 +0200

masqmail (0.0.12-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version: Bugfixes only (should go into frozen, since it
    fixes an RC bug:)
    - setegid in local.c (closes: #58893)
    - set len for getsockname
    - set local_net_routes to NULL if there is no local net
    - warn if spool file could not be deleted
    - say 'mail queue is empty' if mail queue is empty
  * Moved mailq from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin (cf. exim et al).

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Mar 2000 14:25:08 +0200

masqmail (0.0.11-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version: Bugfixes only compared to 0.0.10.

  * To the archive maintainer: I think this version should replace the
    version 0.0.8-3, which is currently in frozen:

    Compared with upstream 0.0.8, the only new features are
    - support to read certain configuration options from files.
    - support for aliases in /etc/aliases. This is a necessary feature
      to comply with Debian policy (closes: #58885).

    Then, there are a few bug fixes since 0.0.11 wrt RFC 822 compliance.

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Mar 2000 17:40:56 +0100

masqmail (0.0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - includes our liblockfile support.
    - support for aliases (fixes: #58885).
  * To conform with Debian policy, we include an shell script
    /usr/bin/newaliases, that calls sendmail -bi (which has no effect
    with MasqMail).

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Feb 2000 13:37:18 +0100

masqmail (0.0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release only has a small change in debian/rules that fixes an
    important bug: /usr/sbin/masqmail was not installed setuid root and
    therefore failed to work if suidmanager was not present at install
    time. In frozen, this bug was fixed simultanously by 0.0.8-3.

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Feb 2000 22:13:01 +0100

masqmail (0.0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

masqmail (0.0.8-3) frozen; urgency=high

  * This release only has a small change in debian/rules that fixes an
    important bug: /usr/sbin/masqmail was not installed setuid root and
    therefore failed to work if suidmanager was not present at install
    time (closes: Bug#58886, Bug#58893).

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Feb 2000 13:16:41 +0100

masqmail (0.0.8-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Now new code, just a simple fix to the command line parsing,
    therefore this upload is targetted for frozen.
  * Patch to allow '--' on command line before the email adress, mimicking
    sendmail's behavior. Necessary to make Debian's mutt package work with
    masqmail, and therefore should go into frozen (closes: Bug#56341
    masqmail: Mutt can't send emails through masqmail).
  * Therefore updates to the man page.
  * Changed Oliver's address and the MasqMail homepage in all documents.

 -- Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Jan 2000 11:51:06 +0100

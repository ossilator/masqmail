Todo list for masqmail
----------------------

Currently, bounce mails (both warnings and errors) can be sent right
before the next route succeeds. This isn't very nice, but is presumably
rare, as queue runs are much more frequent than the warn intervals.

Currently, online_query is pointlessly invoked even after successful
delivery via a static route. Would have to move elimination of
delivered addresses from start of deliver_route_msg_list() to its end.

Possibly add support for RFC 2645 On-Demand Mail Relay (ODMR).
This is probably not too useful. Also, fetchmail supports it,
so it can be used with MasqMail just like for POP3.

This directory contains test cases for masqmail, one in each directory.

Build the test scripts be running
	make
in the directory. You can build all of them by running
	make
in the tests directory.

Run the test by executing
	./test
in its directory, preferably NOT as root, but you got to have write
permission for the directory.


Usually, two log files, masqmail.log and debug.log, will be created.
They may give some information if anything went wrong.

The README files in the test case directories explain the tests in
more detail.


FIXME: Currently, the return values of the test scripts don't express
       if the test was successful or not.


If tests do not work, there could be some problem with either the test
programs, the configuration file or masqmail itself. If you have
installed masqmail successfully and these scripts do not work, do not
worry too much :-).

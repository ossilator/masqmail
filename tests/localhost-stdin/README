localhost-stdin
---------------

Three mails are sent, using different options, to <you@localhost>.
local.sh sends mail accepted from stdin and sends them to a fake local
mailbox, using your login name. If it works, there should be a file
named with your login name with the mails. You can look at it with cat
or less, or with an ordinary mail program.

Two log files, masqmail.log and debug.log will also be created within
this directory. They may give some information if anything went wrong.

Run them from within this directory, preferably NOT as root, but you
got to have write permission for this directory.

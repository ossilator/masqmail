Test hostname-stdin
-------------------

Sends three mails, using different options, to <you@hostname>. The
mails are passed on stdin.

Two log files, masqmail.log and debug.log will also be created within
this directory. They may give some information if anything went wrong.

Run them from within this directory, preferably NOT as root, but you
got to have write permission for this directory.

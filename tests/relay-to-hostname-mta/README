relay-to-localhost-mta
----------------------

Send three mails, using different options, to stdin of masqmail, which
relays it per STMP to a local MTA listening at localhost:25.

So use it only if you have an MTA running on your box (sendmail,
exim, qmail or whatever, or masqmail when you have it already
installed).

If it works, you should get three mails.
Two log files, masqmail.log and debug.log will also be created within
this directory. They may give some information if anything went wrong.

The scripts assume that your login name corresponds to your mailbox
(quite probable) and that your MTA listens on port 25 with the
interface which corresponds to the hostname as returned by the shell
command "hostname" (without quotes...), also very probable.

If the log files reveal that your MTA is not willing to relay, you may
have to qualify the hostname. You might want to do this in a way
similar to:

	sed 's/RECV_HOST/foo.example.org/' test.tpl >test
